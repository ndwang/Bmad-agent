###section Radiation Damping and Excitation

Emission of synchrotron radiation by a particle can be decomposed into two parts. The deterministic
average energy emitted produces damping while the stochastic fluctuating part of the energy spectrum
produces excitation\citeb:jowett.

The treatment of radiation damping by Bmad essentially follows Jowett\citeb:jowett. The energy
loss at a given location is modeled via
  \frac\Delta EE_0 = 
  -k_E \equiv -\left[ k_d \aveg^2 \, L_p + \sqrtk_\mkf \aveg^3 L_p \,\, \xi \right] \, (1 + p_z)^2
where L_p is the actual path length, g is the bending strength (1/g is the bending radius),
and \ave\ldots is an average over the actual path.  In the above equation k_d gives the
deterministic part of the emission, \xi is a Gaussian distributed random number with unit sigma
and zero mean, and k_\mkf is the amplitude of the stochastic part of the emission. Values for k_d
and k_\mkf are calculated via the equations
  k_d= \frac2 \, \rc3 \, \gamma_0^3
  k_\mkf= \frac55 \, \rc \, \hbar24 \, \sqrt3 \, m \, c \, \gamma_0^5
where \gamma_0 is the energy factor of an on-energy particle and \rc is the particles
"classical radius" given by
  \rc = \fracq^24 \, \pi \, \epsilon_0 \, m \, c^2 
where q is the particle's charge and m is the particle's mass.

Ignoring the finite opening angle of the emission for now, the angular orientation of the particle
motion is invariant for forward directed emission which leads to the following equations for the
changes in momentum phase space coordinates
  \Delta p_x = -\frack_E1 + p_z \, p_x , \qquad
  \Delta p_y = -\frack_E1 + p_z \, p_y, \qquad
  \Delta p_z \approx \frac\Delta EE_0 = -k_E 

Synchrotron radiation emission involves energy loss and this energy loss leads to what is known as
the energy "sawtooth" effect where the curve of particle energy on the closed orbit as a function
of longitudinal position has a sawtooth shape. A sawtooth pattern can also be generally seen in the
horizontal orbit. It is sometimes convenient in simulations to eliminate the sawtooth effect. This
can be done by shifting the photon emission spectrum at any given element to have zero average
energy loss along the closed orbit. For this calculation the closed orbit should be the closed orbit
as calculated without radiation damping (in other words the closed orbit without the sawtooth). In
this case, k_E is calculated by
  k_E = \left[ k_d \, \aveg^2 L_p + \sqrtk_\mkf \aveg^3 L_p \,\, \xi \right] \, (1 + p_z)^2 - 
  k_d \, \aveg_0^2 \, L_p
where g_0 is g evaluated along the closed orbit. In practice, for the calculation, Bmad
approximates the closed orbit as the zero orbit. 

The deterministic and stochastic parts of the emission can be included or excluded from a tracking
simulation by setting in a lattice file the Bmad global parameters 
  bmad_com[radiation_damping_on]      = True or False  ! Deterministic part on/off.
  bmad_com[radiation_fluctuations_on] = True or False  ! Stochastic part on/off.
  bmad_com[radiation_zero_average]    = True or False  ! Make ave radiation kick zero.
The global parameter "bmad_com[radiation_zero_average]" controls the shifting of the photon
spectrum to have zero average. Currently, the shifting of the spectrum only works for non PTC
dependent tracking. That is, the shifting is not applicable to tracking with Taylor maps and with
"symp_lie_ptc"  tracking.

The fact that an emitted photon is not exactly colinear with the particle direction (often called
the "vertical opening angle") can be modeled as a separate process from the energy loss. With this
approximation, the change \Delta p_\perp in the momentum transverse to the bending plane is given
by
  \Delta p_\perp = \sqrtk_v \aveg^3 L_p \,\, \xi
where the \xi in \Eqdpkgl is independent of the \xi in \Eqdeekk and
 k_v = \frac13 \, \rc \, \hbar24 \, \sqrt3 \, m \, c \, \gamma_0^3

###section Transport Map with Radiation Included

Transport maps which include radiation effects can be constructed\citeb:ohmi. The first step is to
calculate the reference orbit which is the closed orbit for lattices with a closed geometry and for
lattices with an open geometry the reference orbit is the orbit for some given initial
position. Orbits here are calculated with radiation damping but ignoring stochastic effects. The
transfer map from s_1 to s_2 will be of the form
  \deltar_2 = \calM_21(\deltar_1) + \CalS_21 \f\Xi
where \deltar_1 and \deltar_2 are the particle positions with respect to the reference
orbit at s_1 and s_2 respectively and \calM_21 is the transfer map with damping. The
stochastic radiation part is represented by a 6\times6 matrix \CalS times a 6-vector
  \f\Xi = (\xi_1, \xi_2, \xi_3, \xi_4, \xi_5, \xi_6)
with each \xi_i being an independent Gaussian distributed random number with unit sigma and zero
mean. The stochastic transport (second term in \Eqrmrsx) is treated here only in lowest
order. This is a good approximation as long as the radiation emitted is small enough in the region
between s_1 and s_2. This is true for nearly all practical cases. In the case where this
approximation fails, the equilibrium beam distribution would not be Gaussian and the standard
radiation integral treatment , which relies on this approximation, would not be
valid.

The transfer map with damping \calM is calculated by adding in the effect of the damping
(\Eqspk1pp) when integrating the equations of motion to form the map. Through a given lattice
element, it is generally very safe to assume that the change in energy is small compared to the
energy of a particle. Thus the matrix M through an element, which is the first order part of
\calM, can is computed via first order perturbation theory to be
  M = T + Z
where T is the transfer matrix without damping and Z is the change in T due
to damping computed via
  Z = \int_s_1^s_2 ds \, T_2,s \, d(s) \, T_s,1
where s_1 and s_2 are the longitudinal positions at the ends of the element and
the local damping matrix d is computed from \Eqspk1pp
  d = -k_d \, \beginpmatrix
    0                           0           0                           0           0 0       
    \fracdg^2dx p_x (1+p_z) g^2 (1+p_z) \fracdg^2dy p_x (1+p_z) 0           0 g^2 p_x 
    0                           0           0                           0           0 0       
    \fracdg^2dx p_y (1+p_z) 0           \fracdg^2dy p_y (1+p_z) g^2 (1+p_z) 0 g^2 p_y 
    0                           0           0                           0           0 0       
    \fracdg^2dx (1+p_z)^2   0           \fracdg^2dy (1+p_z)^2   0           0 2 g^2 (1+p_z) 
All quantities are evaluated on the closed orbit. Notice that since \calM_21 is computed with
respect to the beam centroid orbit, there is no constant part to the map. Since T_21 is
invertible, \Eqmtz can be written in the form
  M_21 = \bigl( \boldsymbol1 + Z_21 \, T_21^-1 \bigr) \, T_21 
  \equiv D_21 \, T_21 
D is defined by this equation. The 1-turn damping decrement \alpha for each mode a, b,
and c of oscillation can be calculated from D using Eq.~(86) of Ohmi\citeb:ohmi.

The \CalS matrix (\Eqrmrsx) is calculated by first noting that, to linear order, the
distribution of \deltar_2 due to stochastic radiation over some length ds as some point s
is
  \deltar_2 = \sqrtds \, M_2,s \, \left( F_\mkf(s) \, \xi_1 + F_\mkv \, \xi_2 \right)
where M_2,s is the first order part (matrix) of the map \calM_2,s from s to s_2,
\xi_1 and \xi_2 are two independent Gaussian random numbers with unit sigma and zero mean, and
F_\mkf and F_\mkv are (see)
  F_\mkf= \sqrtk_\mkf g_0^3 \, (0, p_x \, (1 + p_z), 0, p_y \, (1 + p_z), 0, (1 + p_z)^2) 
  F_\mkv= \sqrtk_v g_0 \, (0, -g_y, 0, g_x, 0, 0)
where k_\mkf p_x, p_y and p_z are to be evaluated on the reference orbit and (g_x, g_y) is the
curvature vector which points away from the center of curvature of the particle's orbit. Notice that since
\deltar is, by definition, the deviation from the reference orbit, p_x = r_2 and p_y = r_4
will be zero on the reference orbit. The covariance matrix sig_\gamma is defined by
\sigma_\gamma ij \equiv \langle r_i \, r_j \rangle_\gamma where \langle \ldots \rangle_\gamma
is an average over the photon emission spectrum. The contribution, sig_\gamma21, to the
covariance matrix at s_2 due to the stochastic emission over the region between s_1 and s_2,
is
  sig_\gamma21 = \int_s_1^s_2 ds \, 
    M_2,s \, \big[ 
    F_\mkf(s) \, F_\mkf^t(s) + F_\mkv(s) \, F_\mkv^t(s) \big] \, M_2,s^t
where the t superscript indicates transpose. sig_\gamma21 is related to \CalS via
  sig_\gamma21 = \CalS_21 \, \CalS_21^t
The calculation of \CalS_21 involves calculating sig_\gamma21 via \Eqsmvvm and then
using \Eqsxx to solve for \CalS_21 using, say, a Cholesky decomposition. Notice that while
\Eqsxx does not have a unique solution, what matters here is that \CalS_21 \, \f\Xi (see
\Eqrmrsx) gives the correct distribution. The \CalS_21 matrix may contain columns or rows
that are all zero. This can happen if there are vectors z where z^t sig_\gamma21 z
is zero. For example, in a planer ring where the vertical emittance is zero there will be rows that
are zero.

The covariance matrix sig_\gamma(s_2) at s_2 relative to the covariance matrix at s_1 is
  sig_\gamma(s_2) = sig_\gamma21 + M_21 \, sig_\gamma(s_1) \, M_21^t
The beam size matrix sig is not the same as the covariance matrix since the beam size matrix is
an average over the particles of a beam and not an average over the photon emission
spectrum. However, in equilibrium, the two are the same. To calculate the equilibrium beam size
matrix, \Eqssmsm is recast. For any symmetric 6\times6 matrix A, define the 21-vector
V(A) by
  V(A) \equiv (A_11, A_12, \ldots, A_16, A_22, A_23, \ldots, A_56, A_66)
With s_1 = s_2 = s, and using \Eqssmsm, the equilibrium beam size matrix can be calculated via
  V(sig(s)) = V(sig_\gamma ss) + \wtM \, V(sig(s))
where the 21\times21 matrix \wtM is defined so that for any symmetric A, \wtM \, V(A) =
V(MAM^t). That is
  \wtM = \beginpmatrix
    M_11^2      2 M_11 M_12 \cdots 2 M_15 M_16 M_16 M_16 
    M_11 M_21 2 M_11 M_22 \cdots 2 M_15 M_26 M_16 M_26 
    \vdots        \vdots          \ddots \vdots          \vdots      
    M_51 M_61 2 M_51 M_62 \cdots 2 M_55 M_66 M_56 M_66 
    M_61 M_61 2 M_61 M_62 \cdots 2 M_65 M_66 M_66 M_66
\Eqvsmv is linear in the unknown V(sig) and is easily solved.

The emittances can be calculated from the eigenvalues of the matrix sig \, S
(Wolski\citeb:wolski.coupling Eq.~30) where S is given by \Eqs010000. Specifically, the
eigenvalues of sig \, S are pure imaginary and, using the eigenvector ordering given by
\Eqvsvi0 (which is opposite that of Wolski), the emittances are the imaginary part of the odd
eigenvalues (\epsilon_a, \epsilon_b, \epsilon_c) = (\im\lambda_1, \im\lambda_3, \im\lambda_5).

Unlike the case where radiation is ignored and the motion is symplectic, the calculated emittances
along with the beam size will vary from point to point in a manner similar to the variation of the average
beam energy (sawtooth effect) around the ring .

The emittance calculation makes a number of approximations. One approximation is embodied in
\Eqzstd which assumes that the damping is weak enough so that second order and higher terms can be
neglected. Another approximation is that, within the extent of the beam, the damping as a function
of transverse position is linear. That is, the effect of the damping is well represented by the
matrix d in \Eqzstd. The third major assumption is that, within the extent of the beam, the
stochastic kick coefficient F_\mkf (\Eqfk000) is independent of the transverse coordinates.
Other approximations involve the assumption of linearity of the guide fields and the ignoring of any
resonance or wakefield effects. To the extent that these assumptions are violated, this will lead to
a non-Gaussian beam shape.

###section Synchrotron Radiation Integrals

The synchrotron radiation integrals can be used to compute emittances, the energy spread,
etc. However, using the 6D damped and stochastic transport matrices  has
a number of advantages:

*
Unlike the radiation integrals, the 6D calculation does not make the approximation that the
synchrotron frequency is negligible. Therefore, the 6D calculation will be more accurate.

*
The 6D calculation is simpler: Not as many integrals needed (only 2) and the 6D calculation does not
depend upon calculation of the Twiss parameters.

*
When doing any lattice design which involves constraining the emittances: Since the integrals of the
6D calculation are local (the integrations through any given lattice element are only dependent upon
the properties of that lattice element), by caching integrals element-by-element, the computation of
the emittances can be speeded up. That is, in a design problem, only the parameters of some subset
of all the lattice elements will be varied (for example, a design may only involve varying the
strength of quadrupoles), only this subset of elements needs to have their integrals recomputed.  On
the other hand, the radiation integrals are dependent on the Twiss, dispersion, and coupling
parameters which make the integrals nonlocal.

*
The 6D formalism can be used to construct transport maps with radiation damping and excitation for
efficient particle tracking.

The standard radiation formulas assume no coupling between the horizontal and vertical
plains\citeb:helm,b:jowett. With coupling, the equations need to be generalized and this is
detailed below.

In the general case, the curvature vector g = (g_x, g_y), which points away from the center of
curvature of the particle's orbit and has a magnitude of |g| = 1/\rho, where \rho is the
radius of curvature (see \figf:local.coords), does not lie in the horizontal plane. Similarly, the
dispersion eta\two = (\eta_x, \eta_y) will not lie in the horizontal plane. With this notation,
the synchrotron integrals for coupled motion are:
  \allowdisplaybreaks
    I_0= \oint ds \, \gamma_0 \, g 
    I_1= \oint ds \, g \dotproduct eta 
         \equiv \oint ds \, (g_x \, \eta_x + g_y \, \eta_y) 
    I_2= \oint ds \, g^2 
    I_3= \oint ds \, g^3 
    I_4a= \oint ds \, \left[ g^2 \, g \dotproduct eta\two_a + 
         \nabla g^2 \dotproduct eta\two_a \right] 
    I_4b= \oint ds \, \left[ g^2 \, g \dotproduct eta\two_b + 
         \nabla g^2 \dotproduct eta\two_b \right] 
    I_4z= \oint ds \, \left[ g^2 \, g \dotproduct eta\two + 
         \nabla g^2 \dotproduct eta\two \right] 
    I_5a= \oint ds \, g^3 \, \calH_a 
    I_5b= \oint ds \, g^3 \, \calH_b 
    I_6b= \oint ds \, g^3 \, \beta_b
where \gamma_0 is that usual relativistic factor and \calH_a is 
    \calH_a = \gamma_a \, \eta_a^2 + 2 \, \alpha_a \, \eta_a \, \eta_a' + 
      \beta_a \eta_a'^2 
with a similar equation for \calH_b. Here eta\two_a =
(\eta_ax, \eta_ay), and eta\two_b = (\eta_bx, \eta_by)
are the dispersion vectors for the a and b modes respectively in
x--y space (these 2--vectors are not to be confused with the
dispersion 4--vectors used in the previous section). The position
dependence of the curvature function is:
    g_x(x,y) = g_x + x \, k_1 + y \, s_1 \CRNO
    g_y(x,y) = g_y + x \, s_1 - y \, k_1 
where k_1 is the quadrupole moment and s_1 is the skew--quadrupole moment.
Using this gives on--axis (x = y = 0)
    \nabla g^2 = 2 \left( g_x k_1 + g_y s_1, \, g_x s_1 - g_y k_1 \right)
Note: The above equations must be modified in places in the lattice where there are mode flips
( since an individual integral must be evaluated using the same physical mode
throughout the lattice.

I_0 is not a standard radiation integral. It is useful, though, in calculating the average number
of photons emitted. For electrons:
    \cal N = \frac5 \: \rc m \, c^22 \sqrt3 \, \hbar \, c \, I_0 
where \cal N is the average number of photons emitted by a particle over one turn, and \rc is
the the particle's "classical radius" given by \Eqrq4pe.

In a dipole a non--zero e_1 or e_2 gives a contribution to I_4 via the \nabla g^2 \dotproduct
eta term. The edge field is modeled as a thin quadrupole of length \delta and strength k = -g
\, \tan(e) / \delta. It is assumed that g rises linearly within the edge field from zero on
the outside edge of the edge field to its full value on the inside edge of the edge field. Using
this in \Eqg2gkg and integrating over the edge field gives the contribution to I_4 from a
non--zero e_1 as
    I_4z = -\tan(e_1) \, g^2
    \left( \cos(\theta) \, \eta_x + \sin(\theta) \, \eta_y \right)
With an analogous equation for a finite e_2. The extension to I_4a and I_4b involves using
eta\two_a and eta\two_b in place of eta\two.  In \Eqiegct \theta is the reference
"tilt" angle which is non--zero if the bend is not in the horizontal plane. Here use of the fact
has been made that the g vector rotates as \theta and the quadrupole and skew quadrupole
strengths rotate as 2\, \theta.

The above integrals are invariant under rotation of the (x,y) coordinate system and reduce to the
standard equations when g_y = 0 as they should.

There are various parameters that can be expressed in terms of these integrals. The I_1 integral
can be related to the momentum compaction \alpha_p via
    I_1 = L \, \fracdL/Ldp/p = L \, \alpha_p
where p is the momentum and L is the ring circumference. The can be related to the time slip
factor \eta_p by
  \eta_p = \fracdt/tdp/p = \alpha_p - \frac1\gamma^2

The energy loss per turn is related to I_2 via
    U_0 = \frac2 \, \rc E_0^43 \, (mc^2)^3 I_2
where E_0 is the nominal energy.

The damping partition numbers are related to the radiation integrals via
    J_a = 1 - \fracI_4aI_2 \comma \quad
    J_b = 1 - \fracI_4bI_2 \comma \, \textand \quad \labelj1ii
    J_z = 2 + \fracI_4zI_2 \period
Since 
    eta\two_a + eta\two_b = eta\two
    \comma \labeleee
Robinson's theorem, J_a + J_b + J_z = 4, is satisfied.
Alternatively, the exponential damping coefficients per turn are
    \alpha_a = \fracU_0 \, J_a2 E_0 \comma \quad
    \alpha_b = \fracU_0 \, J_b2 E_0 \comma \, \textand \quad
    \alpha_z = \fracU_0 \, J_z2 E_0 \period
The energy spread is given by
    \sigma_pz^2 = \left( \frac\sigma_EE_0 \right)^2 = 
    C_q \gamma_0^2 \fracI_32I_2 + I_4z
where \gamma_0 is the usual energy factor and 
    C_q = \frac5532 \, \sqrt3 \, \frac\hbarmc = 
    3.832 \times 10^-13 \, \textmeter for electrons
If the synchrotron frequency is not too large, the bunch length is given by
    \sigma_z^2 = \fracI_1M(6,5) \, \sigma_pz^2
where M(6,5) is the (6,5) element for the 1--turn transfer matrix
of the storage ring. Finally, the emittances are given by
    \epsilon_a= \fracC_qI_2 - I_4a 
      \, \gamma_0^2 \, I_5a \CRNO
    \epsilon_b= \fracC_qI_2 - I_4b 
      \, \left( \gamma_0^2 \, I_5b + \frac1355 \, I_6b \right)
The I_6b term come from the finite vertical opening angle of the
radiation\citeb:tol. Normally this term is very small compared to
the emittance due to coupling or vertical kicks due to magnet misalignment.

For a non-circular machine, radiation integrals are still of interest
if there are bends or steering elements. However, in this case, the
appropriate energy factors must be included to take account any
changes in energy due to any "lcavity" elements.  For a
non-circular machine, the I_1 integral is not altered and the I_4
integrals are not relevant. The other integrals become
    L_2= \int ds \, g^2 \, \gamma_0^4 
    L_3= \int ds \, g^3 \, \gamma_0^7 
    L_5a= \int ds \, g^3 \, \calH_a \, \gamma_0^6 
    L_5b= \int ds \, g^3 \, \calH_b \, \gamma_0^6
In terms of these integrals, the energy loss through the lattice is
    U_0 = \frac2 \, \rc \, mc^23 L_2
The energy spread assuming \sigma_E is zero at the start and neglecting
any damping is
    \sigma_E^2 = \frac43 \, C_q \, \rc \, \left( m c^2 \right)^2 \, L_3
The above equation is appropriate for a linac. In a storage ring, where
there are energy oscillations, the growth of \sigma_E^2 due to
quantum excitation is half that. One way to explain this is that in a
storage ring, the longitudinal motion is "shared" between the z and
pz coordinates and, to preserve phase space volume, this reduces
\sigma_E^2 by a factor of 2.

Again neglecting any initial beam width, the transverse beam size
at the end of the lattice is
    \epsilon_a= \frac23 \, C_q \, \rc \, 
    \fracL_5a\gamma_f \CRNO
    \epsilon_b= \frac23 \, C_q \, \rc \, 
    \fracL_5b\gamma_f 
Where \gamma_f is the final gamma.
