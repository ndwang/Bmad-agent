###chapter Fringe Fields

It can be convient to divide the fringe field kick into two pieces. The first piece is called the "hard
edge" fringe kick and is the kick in the limit that the longitudinal extent of the fringe is
zero. The second piece is the "soft edge" fringe kick which is the fringe kick with the fringe
having a finite longitudinal extent minus the hard edge fringe kick. That is
  Total fringe kick = hard fringe kick + soft fringe kick
The advantage of separating the fringe kick in this way is that the hard fringe can be used without
having to know anything about the longitudinal extent of the fringe field. In many cases, this is a
good enough approximation.

Discussion of the fringe parameters of an element are detailed in \Srefs:fringe.

###section Bend Second Order Fringe Map

The bend fringe kick is a combination of the equations developed by Hwang and Lee\citeb:hwang
modified to include quadrupole terms as given in Section~5.3.1 of Iselin\citeb:madphysics. The Lie
map generator \Omega_M given by Hwang and Lee in Eqs.~(35) and (36) is used under the conditions
that
  K_0h = K_1h = K_3h = K_4h = K_5h = K_6h = 0
Here the subscript ""h"" has been added so as to not confuse these parameters with the magnetic
multipole coefficients K_1, K_2, etc. Note: Hwang and Lee do not present an equation for the
change in the longitudinal phase space z coordinate in their paper.

The generator used by Bmad for the entrance fringe is:
  \Omega_M1= \frac(x^2 - y^2) \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_1)2 
  + \fracy^2 \, g_\tot^2 \, \sec^3 (e_1) \, [1 + \sin^2 (e_1)] \, f_int \,  h_gap(1 + p_z) \CRNO
  \qquad + \fracx^3 \, [4 \, K_1 \, \tan (e_1) - g_\tot^2 \, \tan^3 (e_1)]12 \, (1 + p_z)
  + \fracx \, y^2 \, [-4 \, K_1 \, \tan (e_1) + g_\tot^2 \, \tan (e_1) \, \sec^2 (e_1)]4 \, (1 + p_z) 
 \qquad + \frac(x^2 \, p_x - 2 \, x \, y \, p_y) \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_1)2 \, (1 + p_z)
  - \fracy^2 \, p_x \, g_\tot \, \sec^2 (e_1)2 \, (1 + p_z) \nonumber
where g_\tot is the total bending strength (design + error) and K_1 is the quadrupole moment of the bend.
The generator for the exit fringe is
  \Omega_M2= \frac(x^2 - y^2) \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_2)2 
  + \fracy^2 \, g_\tot^2 \, \sec^3 (e_2) \, [1 + \sin^2 (e_2)] \, f_int \,  h_gap(1 + p_z) \CRNO
 \qquad + \fracx^3 \, [4 \, K_1 \, \tan (e_2) - g_\tot^2 \, \tan^3 (e_2)]12 \, (1 + p_z)
  + \fracx \, y^2 \, [-4 \, K_1 \, \tan (e_2) + g_\tot^2 \, \tan (e_2) \, \sec^2 (e_2)]4 \, (1+p_z) 
 \qquad - \frac(x^2 \, p_x - 2 \, x \, y \, p_y) \, g_\tot \tan^2 (e_2)2 \, (1 + p_z)
  + \fracy^2 \, p_x \, g_\tot \, \sec^2 (e_2)2 \, (1 + p_z) \nonumber

The map \cal M is obtained from the equation \Cal M = \exp[\colon\Omega_M\colon]. To second order in the
transverse coordinates the map can be obtained by expanding the exponential to second order
  \Cal M \simeq 1 + \colon\Omega_M\colon + \frac12 \, \colon\Omega_M\colon \, \colon\Omega_M\colon
The transport for the entrance fringe is then
  \Delta x= \fracg_\tot2 \, (1 + p_z) \, \left[ -x^2 \, \tan^2 (e_1) + y^2 \sec^2 (e_1) \right] \CRNO
  \Delta p_x= x \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_1)
    + \fracy^2 \, g_\tot^2 \, [ \tan (e_1) + 2 \, \tan^3 (e_1) ]2 \, (1 + p_z) \CRNO
   \qquad\qquad + \frac(x^2 - y^2) \, K_1 \tan (e_1)1 + p_z
    + \frac(x \, p_x - y \, p_y) \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_1)1 + p_z \CRNO
  \Delta y= \fracx \, y \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_1)1 + p_z 
  \Delta p_y= y \left[ -g_\tot \, \tan (e_1)
    + \frac2 \, g^2_\tot \, [1 + \sin^2 (e_1)] \, \sec^3 (e_1)1 + p_z \, f_int \,  h_gap \right] \CRNO
   \qquad\qquad - \frac(x \, p_y \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_1)1 + p_z 
    - \fracy \, p_x \, g_\tot \, [1 + \tan^2 (e_1)]1 + p_z 
    - \frac2 \, x \, y \, K_1 \tan (e_1)(1 + p_z) \CRNO
  \Delta z= \frac\Omega_M1 - (x^2 - y^2) \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_1)/21 + p_z \nonumber
The transport for the exit fringe is
  \Delta x= \fracg_\tot2 \, (1 + p_z) \, \left[ x^2 \, \tan^2 (e_2) - y^2 \sec^2 (e_2) \right] \CRNO
  \Delta p_x= x \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_2)
    - \frac(x^2 + y^2) \, g_\tot^2 \, \tan^3 (e_2)2 \, (1 + p_z) \CRNO
   \qquad\qquad + \frac(x^2 - y^2) \, K_1 \tan (e_2)1 + p_z
    + \frac(-x \, p_x + y \, p_y) \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_2)1 + p_z \CRNO
  \Delta y= -\fracx \, y \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_2)1 + p_z 
  \Delta p_y= y \left[ -g_\tot \, \tan (e_2)
    + \frac2\, g^2_\tot \, [1 + \sin^2 (e_2)] \, \sec^3 (e_2)1 + p_z \, f_int \,  h_gap \right]
    + \fracx \, y \, g^2_\tot \, \sec^2 (e_2) \, \tan (e_2)1 + p_z \CRNO
   \qquad\qquad + \frac(x \, p_y \, g_\tot \, \tan^2 (e_2)1 + p_z 
    + \fracy \, p_x \, g_\tot \, [1 + \tan^2 (e_2)]1 + p_z 
    - \frac2 \, x \, y \, K_1 \tan (e_2)(1 + p_z) \CRNO
  \Delta z= \frac\Omega_M2 - (x^2 - y^2) \, g_\tot \, \tan (e_2)/21 + p_z \nonumber

###section SAD Dipole Soft Edge Fringe Map

The SAD dipole soft edge fringe model is adapted from the SAD program\citeb:sad. This model is
only used for "sbend", "rbend", and "sad_mult" elements. For "sbend" and "rbend"
elements, the fringe map is defined in terms of the "fint" and "hgap" for the entrance end and
"fintx" and "hgapx" at the exit end . The field integral F_H1 for the
entrance end given is given by (see \Eqfsbbb)
  F_H1 \equiv F_int \, H_gap = \int_pole \! \! ds \, \fracB_y(s) \, (B_y0 - B_y(s))
  2 \, B_y0^2
With a similar equation for F_H2 for the exit end.

For a "sad_mult" element the corresponding parameters are "fb1" and "fb2". the conversion between
the bend and "sad_mult" parameters is
  \textfb1 = 12 \, F_H1, \qquad \textfb2 = 12 \, F_H2

The map itself is
  x_2=  x_1 + c_1 \, p_z \CRNO
  p_y2= p_y1 + c_2 \, y_1 - c_3 \, y_1^3 
  z_2= z_1 + \frac11 + p_z1 \, \left( 
    c_1 \, p_x1 + \frac12 \, c_2 \, y_1^2 -\frac14 \, c_3 \, y_1^4 \right)
    \nonumber
For the entrance face the map parameters are:
  c_1 = \fracg_\tot \, \textfb1^224 \, (1 + p_z)= \frac6 \, g_\tot \, F_H1^21 + p_z, \qquad 
  c_2 = \fracg_\tot^2 \, \textfb16 \, (1 + p_z) = \frac2 \, g_\tot^2 \, F_H11 + p_z, \CRNO
 c_3 = \frac2 \, g_\tot^23 \, \textfb1 \, (1 + p_z) = \fracg_\tot^218 \, F_H1 \, (1 + p_z)
And for the exit face, the appropriate equations can be derived using the substitution
  F_H1\rightarrow F_H2 \CRNO
  g_\tot\rightarrow -g_\tot

In the above equations, for a bend, "g_\tot" is the total bending strength
  g_\tot = \textg + \textdg
"g" being the reference bend strength and "dg" being bend the difference between the actual
and reference bend strengths . For a "sad_mult" element "g_tot" is calculated
from the equation
  g_\tot = \sqrta_0^2 + b_0^2

The SAD dipole soft edge map is "incomplete" and for a realistic fringe map the SAD dipole soft
edge fring map must be combined with a "hard edge" map .

It might seem strange that c_3 diverges to infinity as F_H goes to zero since naively one would
expect the soft edge kick to vanish in the hard edge limit where the fringe has no longitudinal
extent. However, in the hard edge limit, the field does not obey Maxwell's equations. The limiting
map, as F_H goes to zero, has fields that diverge to infinity and this explains why the full (hard
+ soft) limiting map is not the same as the hard edge map at the limit of zero longitudinal extent.

###section Sad_Mult Dipole Hard Edge Fringe Map 

For "sad_mult" elements, the hard dipole edge kick is adapted from SAD. The dipole normalized
field g = \sqrt\texta0^2 + \textb0^2 is calculated from the "a0" and "b0"
multipoles. Before the fringe kick is applied, the particle position is rotated in the (x,y) plane
so that the dipole kick is in the horizontal direction. The dipole edge kick is then given by
  \Delta x= g \, y^2 \, \left( 1 - f_yg \right) \, \frac1 + p_z^22 \, p_zy^3 \CRNO
  \Delta p_y= -g \, p_x \, y \, \frac1 - 2f_ygp_zy 
  \Delta z= -g \, y^2 \, p_x \, (1 - f_yg) \frac1 + p_z2 \, p_zy^3 \nonumber
where
  f_yg = \fracy^2 \, g^212, \quad \textand \qquad
  p_zy = \sqrt(1+p_z)^2 - p_x^2

This is used in place of the dipole hard edge fringe kick given in.

###section Linear Dipole Hard Edge Fringe Map

The linear dipole hard edge fringe model is adapted from MAD\citeb:maduser and only includes linear
terms. The fringe transport is
  \Delta p_x= g_\tot \, \tan(e) \cdot x \CRNO
  \Delta p_y= -g_\tot \, \tan \left( e - 
    \frac2 \, f_int \, h_gap \, g_\tot \, (1 + \sin^2(e))\cos(e) \right) \cdot y
where g_\tot = g + dg is the actual field and e is "e1" if the particle is entering the
dipole and "e2" if the particle is exiting the dipole.

###section Exact Dipole Hard Edge Fringe Map

The exact dipole hard edge fringe is the exact transport in the wedge region of a dipole when there
is a finite "e1" or "e2" as shown in \figf:sbend. This model assumes that there are no
higher order multipole fields. The transport is done in two stages. For a particle entering the
dipole the propagation is
*
Drift (propagate in a straight line) the particle from the sector edge to the actual bend edge. The
propagation may be forward or backwards depending upon on the geometry.

*
Propagate the particle as if it were in the dipole field from the actual bend edge to the sector
edge.
The body of the dipole is treated as a sector bend. At the exit end, the propagation through the
wedge is the reverse of the above.

###section Quadrupole Soft Edge Fringe Map

The quadrupole soft edge fringe model is adapted from SAD\citeb:sad. This fringe is only used with
"sad_mult" and "quadrupole" elements. The fringe map is:
  x_2= x_1 \, e^g_1 + g_2 \, p_x1 \CRNO
  p_x2= p_x1 e^-g_1 \CRNO
  y_2= y_1 \, e^-g_1 - g_2 \, p_y1 
  p_y2= p_y1 e^g_1 \CRNO
  z_2= z_1 - 
    \left[g_1 \, x_1 \, p_x1 + g_2 \, \left( 1 + \fracg_12 \right)
    \, e^-g_1 \, p_x1^2 \right] + 
    \left[g_1 \, y_1 \, p_y1 + g_2 \, \left( 1 - \fracg_12 \right)
    \, e^g_1 \, p_y1^2 \right] \nonumber
where
  g_1 = \fracK_1 \, \textfq11 + p_z , \qquad
  g_2 = \fracK_1 \, \textfq21 + p_z
K_1 is the quadrupole strength, and "fq1" and "fq2" are the fringe
quadrupole parameters. These parameters are related to the field integral I_n
via
  \textfq1 = I_1 - \frac12 \, I_0^2 , \qquad
  \textfq2 = I_2 - \frac13 \, I_0^3
where I_n is defined by
  I_n = \frac1K_1 \, \int_-\infty^\infty \; 
    (K_1(s) - H(s-s_0) \, K_1) \, (s - s_0)^n \, ds
and H(s) is the step function
  H(s) = \begincases
    1   s > 0 
    0   s < 0
and it is assumed that the quadrupole edge is at s_0 and the interior is 
in the region s > s_0. 

See Sec.~ for the relation between "fq1" / "fq2" and
the corresponding "f1" and "f2" parameters of SAD.

###section Magnetic Multipole Hard Edge Fringe Map

The magnetic multipole hard edge fringe field is modeled using the method shown in
Forest\citeb:forest. For the m\Th order multipole the Lee transform 
is (Forest Eq.~(13.29)):
  f_\pm= \mp \Re \left[ \frac(b_m + i \, a_m) \, 
    (x + i \, y)^m+14 \, (m + 2) \, (1 + \delta) \,
    \left{ x \, p_x + y \, p_y + i \fracm+3m+1 
    (x \, p_x - y \, p_y) \right} \right] \CRNO
 \equiv \fracp_x \, f^x + p_y \, f^y1 + \delta
The multipole strengths a_m and b_m are given by \eqbib1nb
and the second equation defines f^x and f^y. On the right had side of the first
equation, the minus sign is appropriate for particles entering the magnet and the
plus sign is for particle leaving the magnet.
Notice that here the multipole order m is equivalent to n-1 in Forest's notation.

With this, the implicit multipole map is (Forest Eq.~(13.31))
  x^f= x - \fracf^x1 + \delta \CRNO
  p_x= p_x^f - \fracp_x^f \, \partial_x f^x + p_y^f \, \partial_x f^y1 + \delta \CRNO
  y^f= y - \fracf_y1 + \delta 
  p_y= p_y^f - \fracp_x^f \, \partial_y f^x + p_y^f \, \partial_y f^y1 + \delta \CRNO
  \delta^f= \delta \CRNO
  z^f=\fracp_x^f \, f^x + p_y^f \, f^y(1 + \delta)^2 \nonumber

###section Electrostatic Multipole Hard Edge Fringe Map

The electric multipole hard edge fringe field, to lowest order, consists of just a longitudinal
field. The integrated longitudinal field at constant (x,y) for the n\Th order multipole is
simply obtained by requiring that the curl of the field is zero.  This gives:
  \int E_s(x,y) \, ds = \phi_n(x,y)
where \phi_n is given in \Eqpbian1. [For a magnetic multipole there is an analogous
equation.]

The effect on the spin when tracking through the fringe field of a multipole field tends
to be weak. As such, this hard edge model is sufficient.  and the spin is tracked using
the T-BMT equation (\Eqtbmt).

###section RF Fringe Fields

Assuming cylindrical symmetry, the radial and azimuthal fields near the axis 
can be related to the longitudinal electric field via Maxwell's equations\citeb:hartman
  E_r = -\fracr2 \, \frac\partial E_z\partial z, \qquad
  B_\phi = \fracr2 \, c \, \frac\partial E_z\partial t
Assuming the particle velocity is c, these equations can be combined with the force equation
  F_r = q \, \left( E_r - c \, B_\phi \right)
to give\citeb:rosenzweig
  F_r = - \fracq \, r2 \, \fracd E_zdz
where the total derivative is used here\footnote
  
Hartman\citeb:hartman Eq~(16) is not valid for a forward propagating wave component of
the field. Thus Hartman Eq~(17) is only valid for a backward propagating wave component. \Eqfqr2,
on the other hand, is valid for all wave components.
  .
From \Eqfqr2, the fringe field kick in the horizontal plane at the entrance end, valid for both
traveling wave and standing wave cavities, is (cf. Rosenzweig\citeb:rosenzweig Eq~(10))
  \Delta p_x = - \fracq \, \what E_z2 \, c \, P_0 \, x
with a similar equation in the vertical. Here \what E_z is the longitudinal electric field just inside
the fringe, and P_0 is the reference momentum. At the exit end, the kick is the negative of
\Eqpqe2c. This fringe kick is built into "xxpc".

The integrated fringe fields, needed to calculate the spin precession, are at the entrance end
  \int E_r \, ds= -\fracr4 \, \what E_z \CRNO
  \int B_\phi \, ds= \fracr4 \, c \, \what E_z
The integrated fields at the exit end are obtained by negating the RHS of these equations.
