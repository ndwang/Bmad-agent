chapter Tracking of X-Rays

Bmad can track both charged particles and X-rays. This chapter deals
with X-rays. Charged particles are handled in chapter~.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bmad can track photons either "coherently" or "incoherently".
In both cases, the photon has a transverse electric field 
  (E_x, E_y)
E_x and E_y are complex and therefore have both amplitude and phase information. When photons
are tracked incoherently, the phase information is not used for calculating X-ray intensities.

In addition to coherent and incoherent tracking, partially coherent simulations can be done by using
sets of photons with the photons in any one set treated as coherent and the photons between sets
being treated as incoherent.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a simulation with incoherent photons, some number of photons,
N_0, will be generated and the i\Th photon (i = 1, \ldots, N_0)
will have a initial "electric field" components E_x0(i),
E_y0(i) assigned to it. The field amplitude E_0 will be
\sqrtE_x0^2 + E_y0^2.

At some an observation point, the power S per unit area falling on
some small area dA due to either x or y component of the
electric field is
  S_x,y = \frac\alpha_pN_0 \, dA \, \sum_j \in \texthits E_x,y^2(j)
where \alpha_p is a constant that can be chosen to fit the
simulation against experimental results, and the sum is over photons
who intersect the area. The factors of N_0 and dA in the above
equation make, within statistical fluctuations, S independent of
N_0 and, for dA small enough, S will be independent of dA as
it should be. The total power is just S_x + S_y.

When traveling through vacuum, the electric field of a photon is a
constant.  As an example, consider a point source radiating uniformly
in 4\pi solid angle with each photon having the same initial field
E_0. An observation area dA situated a distance R from the
source will intercept N_0 \, dA / 4 \, \pi \, R^2 photons which
gives a power of
  S_w = \frac\alpha_p \, E_0^24 \, \pi \, R^2
which falls off as 1/R^2 as expected.

At some places the light may be split into various "channels". An
example is Laue diffraction where X-rays can excite the \alpha and
\beta branches of the dispersion surface. Or a partially silvered
mirror where some of the light is reflected and some is transmitted.
In such a case, the probability P_i of a photon traveling down the
i\Th channel is
  P_i \, \what E_i^2 = \fracS_iS_0
where S_i is the power flowing into channel i, S_0 is the power
flowing into the junction, and \what E_i = E_i / E_0 is the ratio of
the electric field amplitudes of any photon just before and just after being
shunted into the i\Th channel. The probabilities must be properly
normalized
  \sum P_i = 1

If the ratio of the electric field of any photon just before and just
after being shunted into the i\Th channel is not a constant, than
\what E_i must be adjusted so that \what E_i^2 is equal to the average of
\what E_i^2(j) for all photons j channeled into channel i.

As long as \Eqsrpss1 and \eqp1 are satisfied, the choice of the
P_i, and \what E_i are arbitrary. This freedom allows simulation to be
optimized for efficiency. For example, In an actual experiment much of
the light can be lost never to reach a detector and be counted. To
decrease the simulation time, simulated photons may be limited to be
generated with a direction to be within some solid angle \Omega_1 if
photons with a direction outside this solid angle will not contribute
to the simulation results. In this case, there are two channels.
Channel 1 consists of all photons whose direction is within
\Omega_1 and channel 2 is all the other photons. To limit the
photons to channel 1, P_1 is taken to be 1 and P_2 is taken to be
0. Additionally, if the light, say, is being generated isotropically
from a surface into a \Omega_0 = 2 \, \pi solid angle then
  \what E_1 = \sqrt\frac\Omega_1\Omega_0
\what E_2 is infinite here but since no photons are generated in channel 2
this is not a problem.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

In a simulation with coherent photons, some number of photons,
N_0, will be generated and the i\Th photon (i = 1, \ldots, N_0)
will have an initial electric field E_x0(i), E_y0(i) assigned to
it. These quantities will be complex.

At some an observation point, the field E at
some small area dA due to either x or y component of the
electric field is
  E = \frac\alpha_pN_0 \, dA \, \sum_j \in \texthits E(j)
where \alpha_p is a constant that can be chosen to fit the
simulation against experimental results, and the sum is over photons
who intersect the area. In the above equation E(j) is either the x
or y component of the electric field as is appropriate. The factors
of N_0 and dA in the above equation make, within statistical
fluctuations, E independent of N_0 and, for dA small enough, E
will be independent of dA as it should be.

When traveling through a a vacuum, the photons travel ballistically in
straight lines. This is justified by using the stationary phase
approximation with Kirchhoff's integral. the electric field of a
photon varies with the propagation length. There is nothing physical
in this and is just a way to make the bookkeeping come out
correctly. As an example, consider a point source radiating uniformly
in 4\pi solid angle with each photon having the same initial field
component (either x or y) E_1.  An observation area dA
situated a distance R from the source will intercept N_0 \, dA / 4
\, \pi \, R^2 photons and each photon will have a field of E_1 \, R
\, \exp(i \, k \, R) where k is the photon wave number (all photons
must have the same k to be coherent). This gives an electric field
at the observation point of
  E = \frac\alpha_p \, E_1 \, \exp(i \, k \, R)4 \, \pi \, R
which falls off as 1/R as expected.

At a "diffraction_plate" element where diffraction effects are to
be simulated, the following procedure is used:
  *
The electric field components are multiplied by the propagation length L:
  E \rightarrow E \, L
The propagation length is reset to zero so that the at the next point
where the propagation length is factored into the electric field the
propagation length will be the length starting at the aperture.
  *
Depending upon the program, the photon is is either given a random
direction over 2 \, \pi solid angle or the photon's direction
is restricted to be within some solid angle chosen to increase
the probability that the photon will make it through some downstream aperture.

If the photon is restricted to some aperture dependent solid angle of area \Omega,
the photon's electric field is scaled by
  E \rightarrow E \, \frac\Omega4 \, \pi

  *
The electric field components are scaled by
  E \rightarrow E \, \frack4 \, \pi \, i \, (\cos\theta_1 + \cos\theta_2)
where \theta_1 and \theta_2 are the direction cosines of the
incoming and outgoing directions of the photon with respect to the
longitudinal reference axis.
This algorithm is designed so that the resulting fields at points
downstream from the aperture as computed from a simulation will, to
within statistical errors, be the same as one would get using
Kirchoff's integral. That is, the simulation is constructed to be a
Monte Carlo integration of Kirchhoff's integral.

What is, and what is not considered a place where there are
diffraction effects is dependent upon the problem. For example, there
are diffraction effects associated with light reflecting from a mirror
(or any other object) of finite size. If these effects are important
to the experiment, then a procedure similar to the one above must be
followed. 

At places where there are no diffraction effects a simulation can
treat the photons ballistically or can use the aperture procedure
outlined above. While in theory it is possible to choose what to do, in
practice the aperture procedure increases the number of photons that
must be tracked for a given resolution. Thus, from a practical standpoint
the ballistic alternative should always be used.

As explained in, at some places the light may be split
into various "channels". With coherent photons, the analog to \Eqrpss1 is
  P_i \, \what E_i = \fracE_iE_0
where here \what E_i can be complex to take into account phase shifts.
The same considerations about choosing the P_i and \what E_i apply to
coherent photons as incoherent photons. In particular, \what E_1 for the
case of isotropic emission from a surface as in the example in
 (cf. \Eqroo) is
  \what E_1 = \frac\Omega_1\Omega_0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

When there is partial coherence the photons must be divided into
sets. All of the photons of a given set are considered coherent while
the photons of different sets are treated incoherently.

The procedure is to track all the photons of one set coherently and
calculate the field using equation \Eqpanda2. The fields of
different sets are then combined to calculate a power using
\Eqpanda1.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The general procedure for tracking through an element makes use of
"element reference" coordinates (also called just "element"
coordinates). Without any offsets, pitches or tilt , henceforth
called "misalignments", the "element" coordinates are the same
as the "laboratory reference" coordinates (or simply "laboratory"
coordinates) . The "element" coordinates stay fixed
relative to the element. Therefore, if the element is misaligned, the
"element coordinates" will follow as the element shifts in the
laboratory frame as shown in \figf:ele.coord.

For "crystal" , "mirror" , and "multilayer_mirror"
 elements, the "kinked" reference trajectory through the element complicates
the calculation. For these elements, there are three coordinate systems attached to the element as
shown in \figf:photon.ele.coords. Besides the "element entrance" and "element exit"
coordinates, there are "element surface" coordinates with z perpendicular to the surface
pointing inward.

Tracking a particle through an element is therefore a three
step transformation:
*
At the entrance end of the element, transform from the laboratory
reference coordinates to the element's "entrance" or "surface"
coordinates.
*
Track through the element ignoring any misalignments.
*
At the exit end of the element, transform from the element coordinates
to the "laboratory" "exit" coordinates.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

configuration), "mirror", and "multilayer_mirror" elements.  The
origin O of all three are the same but are shown spread out for
clarity.  hat n is the normal to the element surface.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

For elements that have a reference orbit kink
, the element coordinates here are the
"surface" coordinates. Otherwise the element coordinates are
the entrance coordinates.

  *
Apply offsets, pitches and tilt using the formulas in
 along with \Eqswws, and \eqswww.
  *
Apply the "tilt" to the electric field (\Eqertee).
  *
For "crystal", "mirror", and "multilayer_mirror" elements
rotate to element surface coordinates.
 *
Transform the photon's position as if in a drift by a distance -z
where z is the photon's longitudinal coordinate. That is, z will
be zero at the end of the transform to element coordinates (remember
that z is the distance from the start of the element
).

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The back transformation from element to laboratory coordinates is
accomplished by the transformation
  *
For "crystal", "mirror", and "multilayer_mirror" elements
rotate to element from element surface coordinates to element exit coordinates
  *
Apply the reverse "tilt" to the electric field (\Eqertee).
  *
Apply reverse offsets, pitches and tilt using the formulas in
 along with \Eqswws, and \eqswww.

Transformation for Mirror and Crystal Elements Between 
Laboratory and Element Coordinates

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

With photons, the intensities must also be transformed.  The transformation from the entrance
laboratory coordinates to the entrance element coordinates is:
*
Track as in a drift a distance "z_offset_tot".
*
Apply offsets and pitches: The effective "length" of the element is zero 
so the origin of the element coordinates is the same point around which the element is pitched so
  x_1   = x_0 - x_\textoff \CRNO
  p_x1= p_x0 - (1 + p_z0) \, x'_pitch \CRNO
  y_1   = y_0 - y_\textoff 
  p_y1= p_x0 - (1 + p_z0) \, y'_pitch \CRNO
  z_1   = z_0 + x'_pitch \, x_1 + y'_pitch \, y_1 \nonumber
where x_\textoff \equiv "x_offset", x'_pitch \equiv "x_pitch", etc.
*
Apply "ref_tilt" and "tilt":
    R (\theta_tot) \,   
    R (\theta_tot) \, 
    R (\theta_tot) \,   \beginpmatrix E_x1  E_y1 \endpmatrix \nonumber
where E is shorthand notation for
  E \equiv E \, e^i \, \phi
with E being the field intensity and \phi being the field phase angle.
In the above equations R is the rotation matrix
  R(\theta) = \beginpmatrix \cos\theta \sin\theta  -\sin\theta \cos\theta \endpmatrix
with \theta_tot being 
  \theta_tot  = 
    "ref_tilt" + "tilt" + "tilt_corr" "for crystal elements" 
    "ref_tilt" + "tilt" "for mirror elements"
The "tilt_corr" correction is explained in.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The back transformation from exit element coordinates to exit laboratory coordinates is accomplished
by the transformation
  *
Apply "ref_tilt" and "tilt": "ref_tilt" rotates the exit laboratory coordinates with
respect to the exit element coordinates in the same way "ref_tilt" rotates the entrance
laboratory coordinates with respect to the entrance element coordinates. The forward and back
transformations are thus just inverses of each other.  With "tilt", this is not true. "tilt",
unlike "ref_tilt", does not rotate the output laboratory coordinates.  There is the further
complication in that "tilt" is a rotation about the \em entrance laboratory coordinates. The
first step is to express "tilt" with respect to the exit coordinates. This is done with the help
of the S matrix of \Equstt with \alpha_t given by \Eqagg. The effect of the "tilt" can
be modeled as a rotation vector e_in in the entrance laboratory coordinates pointing along
the z-axis
 e_in = (0, 0, \texttilt)
In the exit laboratory coordinates, the vector e_out is
  e_out = S \, e_in
The z component of e_out combines with "ref_tilt" to give
the transformation
    R (-\theta_t) \,   \beginpmatrix x_1  y_1 \endpmatrix \CRNO
    R (-\theta_t) \,   \beginpmatrix p_x1  p_y1 \endpmatrix 
    R (-\theta_t) \,   \beginpmatrix E_x1  E_y1 \endpmatrix \nonumber
where \theta_t is \textref_tilt + e_out,z. The x and y components
of e_out give rotations around the x and y axes
  p_x3= p_x2 - e_out,y \CRNO
  p_y3= p_y2 + e_out,x 
  z_3   = z_2 + x_2 \, e_out,y - y_2 \, e_out,x
  *
Apply pitches: Since pitches are defined with respect to the entrance laboratory coordinates, they
have to be translated to the exit laboratory coordinates
  P_out = S \, P_in
where P_in = (x'_pitch, y'_pitch, 0) is the pitch vector in the entrance laboratory frame
and P_out is the vector in the exit laboratory frame. The transformation is then
  p_x4= p_x3 - P_out,y \CRNO
  p_y4= p_y3 + P_out,x 
  z_4   = z_3 + x_3 \, P_out,y - y_3 \, P_out,x
  *
Apply offsets: Again, offsets are defined with respect to the entrance laboratory coordinates. Like
pitches, the translation is
  O_out = S \, O_in
where O_in = (x_\textoff, y_\textoff, s_\textoff) is the offset in the
entrance laboratory frame. The transformation is
  x_5= x_4 + O_out,x - p_x4 \, O_out,z \CRNO
  y_5= y_4 + O_out,y - p_y4 \, O_out,z 
  z_5= z_4 + O_out,z

\textit\large [Crystal tracking developed by Jing Yee Chee, Ken Finkelstein, and David Sagan]

Crystal diffraction is modeled using dynamical diffraction theory. The notation here follows
Batterman and Cole\citeb:batterman.  The problem can be divided up into two parts. First the
reference trajectory must be calculated. This means calculating the incoming grazing angle
\theta_B,in and outgoing grazing angle \theta_B,out as well as calculating the
transformations between the various coordinate systems. This is done in,
, and.  The second part is the actual tracking of the photon
and this is covered in and
