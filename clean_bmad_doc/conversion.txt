###chapter Lattice File Conversion

A Bmad Distribution  contains a number of translation programs between Bmad
and other formats.

###section MAD Conversion

###subsection Convert MAD to Bmad

Python scripts to convert from MAD8 and MADX are available at:
  util_programs/mad_to_bmad
Due to differences in language definitions, conversions must be done with some care. The following
differences should be noted:
  *
Bmad, unlike \mad, does not have any "action" commands. An action command is a command that makes
a calculation. Examples include \mad's "SURVEY" and "TWISS" commands.
  *
In Bmad all variables must be defined before being used  while \mad will simply take
a variable's value to be zero if it is not defined.
  *
Bmad, unlike \mad, does not allow variable values to be redefined.

###subsection Convert Bmad to MAD

To convert to MAD8 or MADX, the Tao program can be used. Additionally, there is the program
  util_programs/bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant
Since \mad does not have a "wiggler" or a
"sol_quad" element, this conversion routine makes "equivalent" substitution. For a
"sol_quad", the equivalent substitution will be a drift-matrix-drift series of elements. For a
"wiggler", a series of bend and drift elements will be used (the program can also use a
drift-matrix-drift model here but that is not as accurate). The bends and drifts for the
"wiggler" model are constructed so that the global geometry of the lattice does not
change. Additionally the bends and drifts are constructed to most nearly match the wiggler's
  Transfer matrix
  $I_2$ and $I_3$ synchrotron radiation integrals 
Note that the resulting model will not have the vertical cubic nonlinearity that the actual wiggler
has.

###section Convert to PTC

A PTC ""flatfile"" can be constructed using the Tao program with the following commands:
  Tao> ptc init
  Tao> write ptc

###section SAD Conversion

Conversion from "SAD"\citeb:sad to Bmad is accomplished using the Python script
  util_programs/sad_to_bmad/sad_to_bmad.py
Currently, the following restrictions on SAD lattices apply:
  *
SAD "mult" elements cannot have an associated RF field
  *
Misalignments in a "sol" element with "geo" = 1 cannot be handled.

Bmad to "SAD" to conversion can be done with the Tao program or the program 
  util_programs/bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant

###section Elegant Conversion

Conversion from "Elegant"\citeb:elegant to Bmad is accomplished using the Python script
  util_programs/elegant_to_bmad/elegant_to_bmad.py

Bmad to "Elegant" to conversion can be done with the Tao program or the program 
  util_programs/bmad_to_mad_sad_elegant

###section Astra, Blender, CSRTrack, GPT, and Merlin Conversion

Conversion programs to Astra, Blender, CSRTrack, GPT, and Merlin exist in the "util_programs"
directory. Some conversion code is still in beta development so if you encounter
problems please contact a Bmad maintainer.
