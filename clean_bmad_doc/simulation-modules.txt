chapter Simulation Modules

In the Bmad "ecosystem", various modules have been developed to
simulate machine hardware. This chapter provides documentation.

Bmad has the ability to simulate instrumental measurement errors
for orbit, dispersion, betatron phase, and coupling measurements.
The appropriate attributes are listed in and
the conversion formulas are outlined below.

For orbits, the relationship between measured position (x, y)_\textmeas and true position (x,
y)_true is
    x  y
  =
  n_f \, 
    r_1  r_2
  +
  M_m \, 
  \left[
    x  y
  -
    x  y
  \right]
where the Gaussian random numbers r_1 and r_2 are centered at zero and have unit width and the
factor n_f represents the inherent noise in the measurement. In the above equation, (x, y)_0 
represents a measurement offset and M_g is a "gain" matrix written in the form
  M_m
  =
     (1 + dg_x) \, \cos (\theta + \psi) (1 + dg_x) \, \sin (\theta + \psi) 
    -(1 + dg_y) \, \sin (\theta - \psi) (1 + dg_y) \, \cos (\theta - \psi) 
Here dg_x and dg_y represent gain errors and the angles \theta and \psi are tilt and 
"crunch" errors.

In the above equations, various quantities are written as a difference between an "error" quantity
and a "calibration" quantity:
  x_0    = x_\textoff - x_\textcalib \CRNO
  y_0    = y_\textoff - y_\textcalib \CRNO
  \psi   = \psi_\texterr   - \psi_\textcalib \CRNO
  \theta = \theta_\texterr - \theta_\textcalib 
  dg_x   = dg_x,\texterr - dg_x,\textcalib \CRNO
  dg_y   = dg_y,\texterr - dg_y,\textcalib \nonumber
See for the element attribute names that correspond to these quantities.

The calibration component is useful in a simulation where initally the error quantities are set to
represent the errors in the monitors. After this, analysis of orbit data with the machine in various
states can be used to calculate a best guess as to what the errors are. The calculated error values
can then be put in the calibration quantities. This represents a correction in software of the
errors in the monitors. Further simulations of orbit measurements will show how well the actual orbit
can be deduced from the measured orbit.

A dispersion measurement is considered to be the result of measuring the orbit at two different
energies. The measured values are then
    \eta_x  \eta_y
  =
  \frac\sqrt2 \, n_fdE/E \, 
    r_1  r_2
  +
  M_m \, \left[
    \eta_x  \eta_y
  -
  \left(
    \eta_x  \eta_y
  -
    \eta_x  \eta_y
  \right)
  \right]
The factor of \sqrt2 comes from the fact that there are two measurements. M_m is given in \Eqm1dg.

The coupling measurement is considered to be the result of measuring
the beam at a detector over N_s turns while the beam oscillates at a
normal mode frequency with some amplitude A_\textosc.  The
measured coupling is computed as follows. First, consider excitation
of the a-mode which can be written in the form:
    x_i 
    y_i
  =
  A_\textosc \,
    \cos \phi_i 
    K_22a \, \cos \phi_i + K_12a \sin \phi_i
i is the turn number and \phi_i is the oscillation phase on the i\Th turn.
The coefficients K_22a and K_12a are related to the coupling Cbar via
Sagan and Rubin\citeb:coupling Eq.~54:
  K_22a= \frac-\sqrt\beta_b\gamma \, \sqrt\beta_a \, Cbar_22 \CRNO
  K_12a= \frac-\sqrt\beta_b\gamma \, \sqrt\beta_a \, Cbar_12
To apply the measurement errors, consider the general case where the
beam's oscillations are split into two components: One component being
in-phase with some reference oscillator (which is oscillating with the
same frequency as the beam) and a component oscillating out-of-phase:
    x_i 
    y_i
  =
    q_a1x 
    q_a1y
  \, A_\textosc \, \cos (\phi_i + d\phi) +
    q_a2x 
    q_a2y
  \, A_\textosc \, \sin (\phi_i + d\phi)
where d\phi is the phase of the reference oscillator with respect to
the beam.  Comparing \Eqxyapk with \Eqxykkap gives the relation
  K_22a= \fracq_a1x \, q_a1y + q_a2x \, q_a2yq_a1x^2 + q_a2x^2 \CRNO
  K_12a= \fracq_a1x \, q_a2y - q_a2x \, q_a1yq_a1x^2 + q_a2x^2 
This equation is general and can be applied in either the true or
measurement frame of reference.  \Eqxynrr can be used to transform
(x_i, y_i)_\texttrue in \Eqxyapk to the measurement frame of
reference. Only the oscillating part is of interest.  Averaging over
many turns gives
    q_a1x 
    q_a1y
  =  
  M_m \, 
    q_a1x 
    q_a1y
  \comma \qquad
    q_a2x 
    q_a2y
  =  
  M_m \, 
    q_a2x 
    q_a2y
This neglects the measurement noise. A calculation shows that the noise gives a 
contribution to the measured K_22a and K_12a of
  K_22a \rightarrow K_22a + r_1 \, \fracn_fN_s \, A_\textosc 
  \comma \qquad
  K_12a \rightarrow K_12a + r_2 \, \fracn_fN_s \, A_\textosc 
Using the above equations, the transformation from the true
coupling to measured coupling is as follows: From a knowledge of the
true Cbar and Twiss values, the true K_22a and
K_12a can be calculated via \Eqkabgbc. Since the value of d\phi
does not affect the final answer, d\phi in \Eqxykkap is chosen to
be zero.  Comparing this to \Eqxyapk gives
    q_a1x 
    q_a1y
  =
    1 
    K_22a
  \comma \qquad
    q_a2x 
    q_a2y
  =
    0 
    K_12a
Now \Eqkkmkk is used to convert to the measured q's and
\Eqkaqqqq then gives the measured K_22a and K_12a. Finally,
Applying \Eqkkrnn and then \Eqkabgbc gives the measured
Cbar_22 and Cbar_12. 

A similar procedure can be applied to b-mode oscillations to
calculate values for the measured Cbar_11 and Cbar_12.
K_11b and K_12b are defined by
    x_i 
    y_i
  =
  A_\textosc \,
    K_11b \, \cos \phi_i + K_12b \sin \phi_i 
    \cos \phi_i
Comparing this to Sagan and Rubin\citeb:coupling Eq.~55 gives
  K_11b= \frac \sqrt\beta_a\gamma \, \sqrt\beta_b \, Cbar_11 \CRNO
  K_12b= \frac-\sqrt\beta_a\gamma \, \sqrt\beta_b \, Cbar_12
The q_x1b, q_y1b, q_x2b and q_y2b are defined by using
\Eqxykkap with the "a" subscript replaced by "b". The
relationship between K and q is then
  K_11b= \fracq_b1y \, q_b1x + q_b2y \, q_b2xq_b1y^2 + q_b2y^2 \CRNO
  K_12b= \fracq_b1y \, q_b2x - q_b2y \, q_b1xq_b1y^2 + q_b2y^2 

Like the coupling measurement, the betatron phase measurement is
considered to be the result of measuring the beam at a detector over
N_s turns while the beam oscillates at a normal mode frequency with
some amplitude A_\textosc.  Following the analysis of the
previous subsection, the phase \phi is
    \phi_a 
    \phi_b
  =
    \phi_a 
    \phi_b
  +
  \fracn_fN_s \, A_\textosc \, 
    r_1  
    r_2
  -
    \tan^-1 \left( \fracq_a2xq_a1x \right) 
    \tan^-1 \left( \fracq_b2yq_b1y \right)
