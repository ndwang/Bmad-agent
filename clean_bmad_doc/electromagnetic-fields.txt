###section Magnetostatic Multipole Fields

Start with the assumption that the local magnetic field has no longitudinal component
(obviously this assumption does not work with, say, a solenoid).  Following \mad, ignoring
skew fields for the moment, the vertical magnetic field along the y = 0 axis is expanded
in a Taylor series
  B_y(x, 0) = \sum_n B_n \, \fracx^nn 
Assuming that the reference orbit is locally straight (there are correction terms if the
reference orbit is curved ), the field is
  B_x=         B_1 y \plus       B_2 \, xy       
                  \plus& \frac16 B_3 (3x^2 y - y^3) \plus \ldots \CRNO
  B_y= B_0 \plus&B_1 x + \frac12&B_2 (x^2 - y^2) 
                  \plus& \frac16 B_3 (x^3 - 3x y^2) \plus \ldots
The relation between the field B_n and the normalized field K_n is:
  K_n \equiv \fracq \, B_nP_0
where q is the charge of the reference particle (in units of the elementary charge), and P_0 is
the reference momentum (in units of eV/c).  Note that P_0/q is sometimes written as B\rho. This
is just an old notation where \rho is the bending radius of a particle with the reference energy
in a field of strength B. Notice that P_0 is the local reference momentum at the element which
may not be the same as the reference energy at the beginning of the lattice if there are
"lcavity" elements  present.

The kicks \Delta p_x and \Delta p_y that a particle experiences going through a multipole field
is
  \Delta p_x = \frac-q \, L \, B_yP_0 \labelpqlbp1 
             = -K_0 L \;-\; 
            K_1 L \, x \plus 
             \frac12& K_2 L (y^2 - x^2)& \plus 
            \frac16 K_3 L (3x y^2 - x^3) \plus \ldots 
             \nonumber 
  \Delta p_y = \fracq \, L \, B_xP_0 \labelpqlbp2 
             =     
            K_1 L \, y \plus 
            K_2 L \, xy& \plus 
            \frac16 K_3L (3x^2 y - y^3) \plus \ldots \nonumber 
A positive K_1L quadrupole component gives horizontal focusing and vertical defocusing. The
general form is
  \Delta p_x= \sum_n = 0^\infty \fracK_n Ln! 
             \sum_m = 0^2m \le n
             (-1)^m+1 \, x^n-2m \, y^2m 
  \Delta p_y= \sum_n = 0^\infty \fracK_n Ln! 
             \sum_m = 0^2m \le n-1
             (-1)^m \, x^n-2m-1 \, y^2m+1
where \binomab ("a choose b") denotes a binomial coefficient.

The above equations are for fields with a normal component only. If a given multipole field of order
n has normal B_n and skew S_n components and is rotated in the (x, y) plane by an angle
T_n, the magnetic field at a point (x,y) can be expressed in complex notation as
  B_y(x,y) + i B_x(x,y) = 
    \frac1n! (B_n + i S_n) \, e^-i(n+1)T_n \, e^i n \theta \, r^n 
where (r, \theta) are the polar coordinates of the point (x, y).

Note that, for compatibility with MAD, the K0L component of a "Multipole" element rotates the
reference orbit essentially acting as a zero length bend. This is not true for multipoles of any
other type of element.

Instead of using magnitude K_n and rotation angle \theta_n, Another representation is using
normal \wt K_n and skew \wt S_n. The conversion between the two are
  \wt K_n= K_n \, \cos((n + 1) \, T_n) \CRNO
  \wt S_n= K_n \, \sin((n + 1) \, T_n) 

Another representation of the magnetic field used by Bmad divides the fields into normal b_n and
skew a_n components. In terms of these components the magnetic field for the n\Th\ order
multipole is
  \fracq \, LP_0 \, (B_y + i B_x) = (b_n + i a_n) \, (x + i y)^n
The a_n, b_n representation of multipole fields can be used in elements such as
quadrupoles, sextupoles, etc. to allow "error" fields to be represented.  
The conversion between (a_n, b_n) and (K_nL, S_nL, T_n) is
  b_n + i a_n = \frac1n! \, (K_nL + i \, S_nL) \, e^-i(n+1)T_n
In the case where S_nL = 0
  K_n L= n! \, \sqrta_n^2 + b_n^2 
  \tan[(n+1) T_n]= \frac-a_nb_n
To convert a normal magnet (a magnet with no skew component) into a skew magnet (a magnet with no
normal component) the magnet should be rotated about its longitudinal axis with a rotation angle of
  (n+1) T_n = \frac\pi2
For example, a normal quadrupole rotated by 45^\circ becomes a skew quadrupole.

The multipole fields can be ""reference energy"" scaled and/or ""element strength""
scaled.  Scaling here means that the a_n and b_n values used in tracking are scaled from the
input values given in the lattice file.

"Reference energy" scaling is applied if the "field_master" attribute 
is True for an element so that the multipole values specified in the lattice file are not reference
energy normalized
  \bigl[ a_n, b_n \bigr] \longrightarrow
  \bigl[ a_n, b_n \bigr] \cdot \fracqP_0

"Element strength" scaling is applied when the multipoles are associated with a non
"AB_Multipole" element and if the "scale_multipoles" attribute  is
"True". This scaling uses a measurement radius r_0 and a scale factor F:
  \bigl[ a_n, b_n \bigr] \longrightarrow
  \bigl[ a_n, b_n \bigr]
  \cdot F \cdot \fracr_0^n_\REFr_0^n
r_0 is set by the "r0_mag" attribute of an element. F and n_\REF are set
automatically depending upon the type of element as shown in Table~\reft:ab. The
\gamma_p term is

\tt

###section Electrostatic Multipole Fields

Except for the "elseparator" element, Bmad specifies DC electric fields using normal
b_en and skew a_en components . The potential \phi_n for the
n\Th\ order multipole is
  \phi_n = -\re \left[ \fracb_en - i a_enn + 1 \, \frac(x + i y)^n+1r_0^n \right]
where r_0 is a "measurement radius" set by the "r0_elec" attribute of an element
.

The electric field for the n\Th order multipole is
  E_x - i E_y = (b_en - i a_en) \, \frac(x + i y)^nr_0^n
Notice that the magnetic multipole components a_n and b_n are normalized by the
element length, reference charge, and reference momentum (\Eqqlpbb) while their electric
counterparts are not.

Using the paraxial approximation, The kick given a particle due to the electric field is
  \fracdp_xds = \fracq \, E_x\beta \, P_0 \, c, \qquad \fracdp_yds = \fracq \, E_y\beta \, P_0 \, c
Where \beta is the normalized velocity.

###section Exact Multipole Fields in a Bend

For static magnetic and electric multipole fields in a bend, the spacial dependence of the
field is different from multipole fields in an element with a straight geometry as given
by \Eqsqlpbb and \eqexiey. The analysis of the multipole fields in a bend here follows
McMillan\citeb:mcmillan.  

In the rest of this section, normalized coordinates \rw = r / \rho, \xw / = x /
\rho, and \yw = y / \rho will be used where \rho is the bending radius of the
reference coordinate system, r is the distance, in the plane of the bend, from the bend
center to the observation point, x is the distance in the plane of the from the reference
coordinates to the observation point and y is the distance out-of-plane. With this
convention \rw = 1 + \xw.

An electric or magnetic multipole can be characterized by a scalar potential \phi with
the field given by -\nabla \phi.  The potential is a solution to Laplace's equation
  \frac1\rw \, \frac\partial\partial \, \rw 
  \left( \rw \, \frac\partial \, \phi\partial \, \rw \right) +
  \frac\partial^2 \phi\partial \, \yw^2 = 0
As McMillian shows, it is also possible to calculate the magnetic field by constructing the
appropriate vector potential. However, from a practical point of view, it is simpler to use the
scalar potential for both the magnetic and electric fields.

Solutions to Laplace's equation can be found in form
  \phi_n^r = \frac-11+n \sum_p = 0^2p \le n+1 
             (-1)^p \, F_n+1-2p(\rw) \, \yw^2p
and in the form
  \phi_n^i = \frac-11+n \sum_p = 0^2p \le n
             (-1)^p \, F_n-2p(\rw) \, \yw^2p+1
where \binomab ("a choose b") denotes a binomial coefficient, and n is the order
number which can range from 0 to infinity.\footnote
   
Notice that here n is related to m in
McMillian's paper by m = n + 1. Also note that the \phi^r and \phi^i here have a
normalization factor that is different from McMillian.
  
In \Eqpspn2 the F_p(\rw) are related by
  F_p+2 = (p + 1) \, (p + 2) \, \int_1^\rw \fracd\rw\rw 
  \left[ \int_1^\rw d\rw \, \rw \, F_p \right]
with the "boundary condition":
  F_0(\rw)= 1 \CRNO
  F_1(\rw)= \ln \, \rw
This condition ensures that the number of terms in the sums in \Eqspspn1 and \eqpspn2
are finite. With this condition, all the F_p can be constructed:
  F_1= \ln \, \rw = \xw - \frac12\xw^2 + \frac13\xw^3 - \ldots \CRNO
  F_2= \frac12 (\rw^2 - 1) - \ln \rw = \xw^2 - \frac13\xw^3 + \frac14 \xw^4 - \ldots \CRNO
  F_3= \frac32 [-(\rw^2 - 1) + (\rw^2 + 1) \ln \rw] = \xw^3 - \frac12 \xw^4 + \frac720 \xw^5 - \ldots 
  F_4= 3 [ \frac18 (\rw^4 - 1) + \frac12 (\rw^2 - 1) - (\rw^2 + \frac12) \ln \rw] = 
         \xw^4 - \frac25 \xw^5 + \frac310 \xw^6 - \ldots \CRNO
 \textEtc... \nonumber
Evaluating these functions near \xw = 0 using the exact \rw-dependent functions can be
problematical due to round off error. For example, Evaluating F_4(\rw) at \xw = 10^-4 results
in a complete loss of accuracy (no significant digits!) when using double precision numbers. In
practice, Bmad uses a Pad\'e approximant for \xw small enough and then switches to the
\rw-dependent formulas for \xw away from zero.

For magnetic fields, the "real" \phi_n^r solutions will correspond to skew fields and the
"imaginary" \phi_n^i solutions will correspond to normal fields
  B = -\fracP_0q \, L \, 
    \sum_n = 0^\infty \rho^n \, \left[ a_n \, \widetilde \nabla \phi_n^r + b_n \, \widetilde \nabla \phi_n^i \right]
where the gradient derivatives of \widetilde \nabla are with respect to the normalized
coordinates. In the limit of infinite bending radius \rho, the above equations converge
to the straight line solution given in \Eqqlpbb.

For electric fields, the "real" solutions will correspond to normal fields and the
"imaginary" solutions are used for skew fields
  E = -\sum_n = 0^\infty \rho^n \, \left[ a_en \, \widetilde \nabla \phi_n^i + 
  b_en \, \widetilde \nabla \phi_n^r \right]
And this will converge to \Eqexiey in the straight line limit.

In the vertical plane, with \xw = 0, the solutions \phi_n^r and \phi_n^i have the same
variation in \yw as the multipole fields with a straight geometry. For example, the field
strength of an n = 1 (quadrupole) multipole will be linear in \yw for \xw = 0. However, in the
horizontal direction, with \yw = 0, the multipole field will vary like dF_2/d\xw which has
terms of all orders in \xw. In light of this, the solutions \phi_n^r and \phi_n^i are
called "vertically pure" solutions.

It is possible to construct "horizontally pure" solutions as well. That is, it is possible to
construct solutions that in the horizontal plane, with \yw = 0, behave the same as the corresponding
multipole fields with a straight geometry. A straight forward way to do this, for some given
multipole of order n, is to construct the horizontally pure solutions, \psi_n^r and \psi_n^i,
as linear superpositions of the vertically pure solutions
  \psi_n^r = \sum_k = n^\infty C_nk \, \phi_k^r, \qquad
  \psi_n^i = \sum_k = n^\infty D_nk \, \phi_k^i
with the normalizations C_nn = D_nn = 1. The C_nk and D_nk are chosen, order
by order, so that \psi_n^r and \psi_n^i are horizontally pure. For the real
potentials, the C_nk, are obtained from a matrix M where M_ij is the
coefficient of the \xw^j term of (dF_i/d\xw)/i when F_i is expressed as an expansion in
\xw (\Eqffff). C_nk, k = 0, \ldots, \infty are the row vectors of the inverse
matrix M^-1. For the imaginary potentials, the D_nk are constructed similarly
but in this case the rows of M are the coefficients in \xw for the functions F_i.
To convert between field strength coefficients, \Eqsbpql and \eqenrn and \Eqsp1rc
are combined
  a_n= \sum_k = n^\infty \frac1\rho^k-n \, C_nk \, \alpha_k, \quad 
 a_en= \sum_k = n^\infty \frac1\rho^k-n \, D_nk \, \alpha_ek, \CRNO
  b_n= \sum_k = n^\infty \frac1\rho^k-n \, D_nk \, \beta_k, \quad
 b_en= \sum_k = n^\infty \frac1\rho^k-n \, D_nk \, \beta_ek
where \alpha_k, \beta_k, \alpha_ek, and \beta_ek are the corresponding coefficients
for the horizontally pure solutions.

When expressed as a function of \rw and \yw, the vertically pure solutions \phi_n have a
finite number of terms (\Eqspspn1 and \eqpspn2). On the other hand, the horizontally
pure solutions \psi_n have an infinite number of terms.

The vertically pure solutions form a complete set. That is, any given field that satisfies
Maxwell's equations and is independent of z can be expressed as a linear combination of
\phi_n^r and \phi_n^i. Similarly, the horizontally pure solutions form a complete
set. [It is, of course, possible to construct other complete sets in which the basis
functions are neither horizontally pure nor vertically pure.]

This brings up an important point. To properly simulate a machine, one must first of all
understand whether the multipole values that have been handed to you are for horizontally
pure multipoles, vertically, pure multipoles, or perhaps the values do not correspond to
either horizontally pure nor vertically pure solutions! Failure to understand this point
can lead to differing results. For example, the chromaticity induced by a horizontally
pure quadrupole field will be different from the chromaticity of a vertically pure
quadrupole field of the same strength. With Bmad, the "exact_multipoles"
 attribute of a bend is used to set whether multipole values are for
vertically or horizontally pure solutions. [Note to programmers: PTC always assumes
coefficients correspond to horizontally pure solutions. The Bmad PTC interface will
convert coefficients as needed.]

###section Map Decomposition of Magnetic and Electric Fields

Electric and magnetic fields can be parameterized as the sum over a number of functions
with each function satisfying Maxwell's equations. These functions are also referred to as
"maps", "modes", or "terms". Bmad has three parameterizations:
  Cartesian Map              !.
  Cylindrical Map             
  Generalized Gradient Map    
These parameterizations are three of the four "field map" parameterizations that Bmad
defines.

The "Cartesian map" decomposition involves a set of terms, each term a solution the
Laplace equation solved using separation of variables in Cartesian coordinates. This
decomposition can be used for DC but not AC fields. See.
for more details. The syntax for specifying the "Cartesian map" decomposition
is discussed in.

The "cylindrical map" decomposition can be used for both DC and AC fields. See
 for more details. The syntax for specifying the "cylindrical map"
decomposition is discussed in.

The "generalized gradient map" start with the cylindrical map decomposition but then express the
field using coefficients derived from an expansion of the scalar potential in powers of the radius
.

###section Cartesian Map Field Decomposition

Electric and magnetic fields can be parameterized as the sum over a number of functions
with each function satisfying Maxwell's equations. These functions are also referred to as
"maps", "modes", or "terms". Bmad has two types. The ""Cartesian""
decomposition is explained here. The other type is the "cylindrical" decomposition
.

The "Cartesian" decomposition implemented by Bmad involves a set of terms, each
term a solution the Laplace equation solved using separation of variables in Cartesian
coordinates. This decomposition is for DC electric or magnetic fields. No AC Cartesian Map
decomposition is implemented by Bmad. In a lattice file, a "Cartesian" map is specified using
the "cartesian_map" attribute as explained in Sec.~.

The "Cartesian" decomposition is modeled using an extension of the method of Sagan,
Crittenden, and Rubin\citeb:wiggler. In this decomposition, the magnetic(or electric
field is written as a sum of terms B_i (For concreteness the symbol B_i is used but
the equations below pertain equally well to both electric and magnetic fields) with:
  B(x,y,z) = \sum_i B_i(x, y, z; A, k_x, k_y, k_z, x_0, y_0, \phi_z, family)
Each term B_i is specified using seven numbers (A, k_x, k_y, k_z,
x_0, y_0, \phi_z) and a switch called "family" which can be one of:
  x,  qu
  y,  sq
Roughly, taking the offsets x_0 and y_0 to be zero (see the equations below), the "x"
"family" gives a field on-axis where the y component of the field is zero. that is, the "x"
family is useful for simulating, say, magnetic vertical bend dipoles. The "y" "family" has a
field that on-axis has no x component. The "qu" "family" has a magnetic quadrupole like
(which for electric fields is skew quadrupole like) field on-axis and the "sq" "family" has a
magnetic skew quadrupole like field on-axis. Additionally, assuming that the x_0 and y_0 offsets
are zero, the "sq" family, unlike the other three families, has a nonzero on-axis z field
component.

Each family has three possible forms These are designated as ""hyper-y"",
""hyper-xy"", and ""hyper-x"". 

For the "x" "family" the "hyper-y" form is:
  B_x=A \,\dfrack_xk_y \cos(\kxx) \, \cosh(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_y=A \,                 \sin(\kxx) \, \sinh(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_s= -&&A \,\dfrack_zk_y \sin(\kxx) \, \cosh(\kyy) \, \sin(\kzz) \labelcm1 
&&& \textwith \,\, k_y^2 = k_x^2 + k_z^2 \nonumber
The "x" "family" "hyper-xy" form is:
  B_x=A \,\dfrack_xk_z \cosh(\kxx) \, \cosh(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_y=A \,\dfrack_yk_z \sinh(\kxx) \, \sinh(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_s= -&&A \,                 \sinh(\kxx) \, \cosh(\kyy) \, \sin(\kzz) \labelcm3 
&&& \textwith \,\, k_z^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2 \nonumber
And the "x" "family" "hyper-x" form is:
  B_x=A \,                 \cosh(\kxx) \, \cos(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_y= -&&A \,\dfrack_yk_x \sinh(\kxx) \, \sin(\kyy) \, \cos(\kzz) \CRNEG
  B_s= -&&A \,\dfrack_zk_x \sinh(\kxx) \, \cos(\kyy) \, \sin(\kzz) \labelcm5 
&&& \textwith \,\, k_x^2 = k_y^2 + k_z^2 \nonumber

The relationship between k_x, k_y, and k_z ensures that
Maxwell's equations are satisfied. Notice that which form
"hyper-y", "hyper-xy", and "hyper-x" a particular B_i
belongs to can be computed by Bmad by looking at the values of k_x,
k_y, and k_z.

Using a compact notation where \Ch \equiv \cosh, subscript x is \kxx, subscript z
is \kzz, etc., the "y" "family" of forms is:

   k_z^2 = k_x^2 + k_y^2
   k_x^2 = k_y^2 + k_z^2 \nonumber

The singular case where k_x = k_y = k_z = 0 is not allowed. If a uniform field is needed, a term
with very small k_x, k_y, and k_z can be used. Notice that since k_y must be non-zero for
the "hyper-y" forms (remember, k_y^2 = k_x^2 + k_z^2 for these forms and not all k's can be
zero), and k_z must be non-zero for the "hyper-xy" forms, and k_x must be nonzero for the
"hyper-x" forms. The magnetic field is always well defined even if one of the k's is zero.

Note: The vector potential for these fields is given in.

###section Cylindrical Map Decomposition

Electric and magnetic fields can be parameterized as the sum over a number of functions with each
function satisfying Maxwell's equations. These functions are also referred to as "maps",
"modes", or "terms". Bmad has two types. The ""cylindrical"" decomposition is explained
here. The other type is the "Cartesian" decomposition .

In a lattice file, a "cylindrical" map is specified using the "cylindrical_map" attribute as
explained in Sec.~.

The "cylindrical" decomposition takes one of two forms depending upon whether the fields are time
varying or not. The DC decomposition is explained in Sec.~ while the RF
decomposition is explained in Sec.~.

###subsection DC Cylindrical Map Decomposition

The DC "cylindrical" parametrization used by Bmad essentially follows Venturini et
al.\citeb:vent.map. See Section~ for details on the syntax used to cylindrical
maps in Bmad. The electric and magnetic fields are both described by a scalar potential\footnote
  
Notice the negative sign here and in \Eqpsps1k compared to Venturini et al.\citeb:vent.map. This
is to keep the definition of the electric scalar potential \psi_E consistent with the normal
definition.
  
  B = -\nabla \, \psi_B, \qquad E = -\nabla \, \psi_E
The scalar potentials both satisfy the Laplace equation \nabla^2 \, \psi = 0.
The scalar potentials are decomposed as a sum of modes indexed by an integer m
  \psi_B = \re \left[ \sum_m = 0^\infty \, \psi_Bm \right]
[Here and below, only equations for the magnetic field will be shown. The equations for the electric
fields are similar.] The \psi_Bm are decomposed in z using a discrete Fourier
sum.\footnote
  
Venturini uses a continuous Fourier transformation but Bmad uses a discrete
transformation so that only a finite number of coefficients are needed.
  
Expressed in cylindrical coordinates the decomposition of \psi_Bm is
  \psi_Bm = \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \psi_Bmn =
  \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \frac-1k_n \, e^i \, k_n \, z \,
  \cos (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \, I_m(k_n \, \rho)
where I_m is a modified Bessel function of the first kind, and the
b_m(n) are complex coefficients. [For electric fields, e_m(n) is
substituted for b_m(n)] In \Eqpsps1k k_n is
given by
  k_n = \frac2 \pi \, nN \, dz
where N is the number of "sample points", and dz is the longitudinal "distance between
points". That is, the above equations will only be accurate over a longitudinal length (N-1)
\, dz. Note: Typically the sum in \Eqpsps1k and other equations below runs from 0 to N-1.
Using a sum from -N/2 to N/2-1 gives exactly the same field at the sample points (z = 0, dz,
2\,ds, \ldots) and has the virtue that the field is smoother in between.

The field associated with \psi_Bm is for m = 0:
  B_\rho= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 e^i \, k_n \, z \, b_0(n) \,
    I_1(k_n \, \rho) \right] \CRNO
  B_\theta= 0 
  B_z= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 i \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, b_0(n) \,
    I_0(k_n \, \rho) \right]
    \nonumber

And for m \neq 0:
  B_\rho= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \frac12 \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \cos (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \,
    \ig[ I_m-1(k_n \, \rho) + I_m+1(k_n \, \rho) \ig] \right] \CRNO
  B_\theta= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \frac-12 \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \sin (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \,
    \ig[ I_m-1(k_n \, \rho) - I_m+1(k_n \, \rho) \ig] \right] 
  B_z= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 i \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \cos (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \,
    I_m(k_n \, \rho) \right]
    \nonumber

While technically \psi_Bm0 is not well defined due to the 1/k_n factor that is present, the
field itself is well behaved. Mathematically, \Eqpsps1k can be corrected if, for n = 0, the term
I_m(k_n \, \rho) / k_n is replaced by
  \fracI_m(k_0 \, \rho)k_0 \rightarrow 
    \rho  \textif  m = 0 
    \rho/2\textif  m = 1 
    0     \textotherwise

The magnetic vector potential for m = 0 is constructed such that only A_\theta is non-zero
  A_\rho= 0 \CRNO
  A_\theta= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \fracik_n \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, b_0(n) \, I_1(k_n \, \rho) \right] 
  A_z   = 0 \nonumber
For m \ne 0, the vector potential is chosen so that A_\theta is zero.
  A_\rho= \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \frac-i \, \rho2 \, m \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \cos (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \,
    \ig[ I_m-1(k_n \, \rho) - I_m+1(k_n \, \rho) \ig] \right] \CRNO
  A_\theta= 0 
  A_z   = \re \left[ 
    \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 \frac-i \, \rhom \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \cos (m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \, b_m(n) \,
    I_m(k_n \, \rho) \right] \nonumber

Note: The description of the field using ""generalized gradients""\citeb:newton is similar to
the above equations. The difference is that, with the generalized gradient formalism, terms in
\theta and \rho are expanded in a Taylor series in x and y.

###subsection AC Cylindrical Map Decomposition

For RF fields, the "cylindrical" mode parametrization used by Bmad essentially
follows Abell\citeb:rf.abell. The electric field is the real part of the complex field
  E(r) = \sum_j=1^M \, E_j(r) \, \exp[-2 \pi i \, (f_j \, t + \phi_0j)]
where M is the number of modes. Each mode satisfies the vector Helmholtz
equation
  \nabla^2 E_j + k_tj^2 \, E_j = 0
where k_tj = 2 \, \pi \, f_j/c with f_j being the mode frequency.

The individual modes vary azimuthally as \cos(m \, \theta - \theta_0) where m is a non-negative
integer.  [in this and in subsequent equations, the mode index j has been dropped.]  For the m =
0 modes, there is an accelerating mode whose electric field is in the form
  E_\rho(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 -e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    i \, k_n \, e_0(n) \, \wt I_1(\kappa_n, \rho) \CRNO
  E_\theta(r)= 0 
  E_z(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    e_0(n) \, \wt I_0(\kappa_n, \rho) \nonumber
where \wt I_m is
  \wt I_m (\kappa_n, \rho) \equiv \fracI_m(\kappa_n \, \rho)\kappa_n^m
with I_m being a modified Bessel function first kind, and \kappa_n is given by
  \kappa_n = \sqrtk_n^2 - k_t^2 = 
    \sqrtk_n^2 - k_t^2 |k_n| > k_t 
    -i \, \sqrtk_t^2 - k_n^2 k_t > |k_n|
with
  k_n = \frac2 \pi \, nN \, dz
N is the number of points where E_zc is evaluated, and dz is
the distance between points. The length of the field region is (N-1) \, dz. When
\kappa_n is imaginary, I_m(\kappa_n \, \rho) can be evaluated
through the relation
  I_m(-i \, x) = i^-m \, J_m(x)
where J_m is a Bessel function of the first kind.
The e_0 coefficients can be obtained given knowledge of the field at some radius R via
  e_0(n)= \frac1\wt I_0(\kappa_n, R) \, \frac1N \, \sum_p=0^N-1
    e^-2 \pi i n p / N \, E_z(R, p \, dz)

The non-accelerating m = 0 mode has an electric field in the form
  E_\rho(r)= E_z(r) = 0 \CRNO
  E_\theta(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1e^i k_n z \, 
    b_0(n) \, \wt I_1(\kappa_n, \rho)
where the b_0 coefficients can be obtained given knowledge of the field at some radius R via
  b_0(n) = \frac1\wt I_1(\kappa_n, R) \, \frac1N \, \sum_p=0^N-1
    e^-2 \pi i \, n \, p / N \, E_\theta(R, p \, dz)

For positive m, the electric field is in the form
  E_\rho(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1
    -i \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \left[ 
    k_n \, e_m(n) \, \wt I_m+1(\kappa_n, \rho) +
    b_m(n) \, \frac\wt I_m(\kappa_n, \rho)\rho
    \right]
    \cos(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \CRNO
  E_\theta(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1 
    -i \, e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    \left[
    k_n \, e_m(n) \, \wt I_m+1(\kappa_n, \rho) \, + \right. 
  \left. \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad
    b_m(n) \, \left( \frac\wt I_m(\kappa_n, \rho)\rho - 
    \frac1m \, \wt I_m-1(\kappa_n, \rho) \right)
    \right] 
    \sin(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \CRNO
  E_z(r)= \sum_n=-N/2^N/2-1e^i \, k_n \, z \, 
    e_m(n) \, \wt I_m(\kappa_n, \rho) \cos(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \nonumber
The "e_m" and "b_m" coefficients can be obtained given knowledge of the field at some radius R via
  e_m(n)= \frac1\wt I_m(\kappa_n, R) \, \frac1N \, \sum_p=0^N-1
    e^-2 \, \pi \, i \, n \, p / N \, E_zc(R, p \, dz) \CRNO
  b_m(n)= \fracR\wt I_m(\kappa_n, R) \left[
    \frac1N \, \sum_p=0^N-1
    i \, e^-2 \, \pi \, i \, n \, p / N \, E_\rho c(R, p \, dz) -
    k_n \, e_m(n) \, \wt I_m+1(\kappa_n, R)
    \right]
where E_\rho c, E_\theta s, and E_z c are defined by
  E_\rho(R, \theta, z)= E_\rho c(R, z) \, \cos(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \CRNO
  E_\theta(R, \theta, z)= E_\theta s(R, z) \, \sin(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) 
  E_z(R, \theta, z)   = E_z c(R, z)    \, \cos(m \, \theta - \theta_0m) \nonumber

The above mode decomposition was done in the gauge where the scalar potential \psi is zero. The
electric and magnetic fields are thus related to the vector potential A via
  E = -\partial_t \, A, \qquad B = \nabla \times A
Using \Eqeseei, the vector potential can be obtained from the electric field via
  A_j = \frac-i \, E_j2 \, \pi \, f_j
 
Symplectic tracking through the RF field is discussed in Section~.  For the
fundamental accelerating mode, the vector potential can be analytically integrated using the
identity
  \int dx \,\fracx \, I_1 (a \, \sqrtx^2+y^2)\sqrtx^2+y^2  = 
  \frac1a \, I_0 (a \, \sqrtx^2+y^2)

###section Generalized Gradient Map Field Modeling

Bmad has a number of "field map" models that can be used to model electric or magnetic fields
. One model involves what are called "generalized gradients"\citeb:gen.grad.
This model is restricted to modeling DC magnetic or electric fields. In a lattice file, the
generalized gradient field model is specified using the "gen_grad_map" attribute as explained
in Sec.~.

The electric and magnetic fields are both described by a scalar potential\footnote
  
Notice the negative sign here and in \Eqppmpp compared to Venturini et al.\citeb:gen.grad. This
is to keep the definition of the electric scalar potential \psi_E consistent with the normal
definition.
  
  B = -\nabla \, \psi_B, \qquad E = -\nabla \, \psi_E
The scalar potential is then decomposed into azimuthal components
  \psi = \sum_m = 1^\infty \psi_m,s \, \sin(m \theta) + \sum_m = 0^\infty \psi_m,c \, \cos(m \theta)
where the \psi_m,\alpha (\alpha = c,s) are characterized by a using functions
C_m,\alpha(z) which are functions along the longitudinal z-axis.
  \psi_m,\alpha = \sum_n = 0^\infty \frac(-1)^n+1 m!4^n \, n! \, (n+m)! 
  \, \rho^2n+m \, C_m,\alpha^[2n](z) 
The notation [2n] indicates the 2n\Th derivative of C_m,\alpha(z).

From \Eqppmpp the field is given by
  B_\rho  = \sum_m = 1^\infty \sum_n = 0^\infty \frac(-1)^n \, m! \, (2n+m)4^n \, n! \, (n+m) 
    \rho^2n+m-1 \left[ C^[2n]_m,s(z) \, \sin m\theta + C^[2n]_m,c(z) \, \cos m\theta \right] + \CRNO
    \hspace25 em \sum_n = 1^\infty \frac(-1)^n \, 2n4^n n! \, n! \rho^2n-1 \, C^[2n]_0,c(z) \CRNO
  B_\theta= \sum_m = 1^\infty \sum_n = 0^\infty \frac(-1)^n \, m! \, m4^n \, n! \, (n+m) 
    \rho^2n+m-1 \left[ C^[2n]_m,s(z) \, \cos m\theta - C^[2n]_m,c(z) \, \sin m\theta \right] 
  B_z     = \sum_m = 0^\infty \sum_n = 0^\infty \frac(-1)^n \, m!4^n \, n! \, (n+m) 
    \rho^2n+m \left[ C^[2n+1]_m,s(z) \, \sin m\theta + C^[2n+1]_m,c(z) \, \cos m\theta \right] \nonumber
Even though the scalar potential only involves even derivatives of C_m,\alpha, the field is
dependent upon the odd derivatives as well. The multipole index m is such that m = 0 is for
solenoidal fields, m = 1 is for dipole fields, m = 2 is for quadrupolar fields, etc. The
"sin"--like generalized gradients represent normal (non-skew) fields and the "cos"--like one
represent skew fields. The on-axis fields at x=y=0 are given by:
  (B_x, B_y, B_z) = (C_1,c, C_1,s, -C^[1]_0,c)

The magnetic vector potential for m = 0 is constructed such that only A_\theta is non-zero
  A_\rho  = 0 \CRNO
  A_\theta= \sum_n=1^\infty 
    \frac(-1)^n+1 \, 2n4^n \, n! \, n! \rho^2n-1 \, C_0,c^[2n-1] 
  A_z     = 0 \nonumber
For m \ne 0, the vector potential is chosen so that A_\theta is zero.
  A_\rho  = \sum_m = 1^\infty \sum_n=0^\infty 
    \frac(-1)^n \, (m-1)!4^n \, n! \, (n+m)! \rho^2n+m+1 \, 
    \left[ C_m,s^[2n+1] \cos(m \theta) - C_m,c^[2n+1] \, \sin(m \theta) \right] \CRNO 
  A_\theta= 0 
  A_z     = \sum_m = 1^\infty \sum_n=0^\infty 
    \frac(-1)^n \, (m-1)! \, (2n+m)4^n \, n! \, (n+m)! \rho^2n+m \, 
    \left[ -C_m,s^[2n] \cos(m \theta) + C_m,c^[2n] \, \sin(m \theta) \right]
  \nonumber

The functions C_m,\alpha(z) are characterized by specifying C_m,\alpha(z_i) and derivatives
at equally spaced points z_i, up to some maximum derivative order N_m,\alpha chosen by the
user. Interpolation is done by constructing an interpolating polynomial ("non-smoothing spline")
for each GG of order 2N_m,\alpha+1 for each
interval [z_i, z_i+1] which has the correct derivatives from 0 to N_m,\alpha at points z_i and
z_i+1. The coefficients of the interpolating polynomial are easily calculated by inverting the
appropriate matrix equation.

The advantages of a generalized gradient map over a cylindrical or Cartesian map decomposition come
from the fact that with generalized gradients the field at some point (x,y,z) is only dependent
upon the value of C_m,\alpha(z) and derivatives at points z_i and z_i+1 where z is in
the interval [z_i, z_i+1]. This is in contrast to the cylindrical or Cartesian map decomposition
where the field at any point is dependent upon \em all of the terms that characterize the
field. This ""locality"" property of generalized gradients means that calculating coefficients
is easier (the calculation of C_m,\alpha(z) at z_i can be done using only the field near z_i
independent of other regions) and it is easier to ensure that the field goes to zero at the
longitudinal ends of the element. Additionally, the evaluation is faster since only coefficients to
either side of the evaluation point contribute. The disadvantage of generalized gradients is that
since the derivatives are truncated at some order N_m,\alpha, the resulting field does not satisfy
Maxwell's equations with the error as a function of radius scaling with the power \rho^m+N_m,\alpha.

It is sometimes convenient to express the fields in terms of Cartesian coordinates. For sine like
even derivatives C_m,s^[2n] the conversion is
  \left( B_x, B_y \right)= \left( \cos\theta \, B_\rho - \sin\theta \, B_\theta, \,
    \sin\theta \, B_\rho + \cos\theta \, B_\theta \right) \CRNO
 = \frac(-1)^n \, m!4^n n! \, (n+m)! \, C_m,s^[2n] \, \ig[ (n+m) \, (x^2 + y^2)^n \,
    \left( S_xy(m-1), \, C_xy(m-1) \right) \, + 
 \hspace13em  n \, (x^2 + y^2)^n-1 \, 
    \left( S_xy(m+1), \, -C_xy(m+1) \right) \ig] \nonumber
and for the sine like odd derivatives C_m,s^[2n+1]
  B_z = \frac(-1)^n \, m!4^n n! \, (n+m) 
    (x^2 + y^2)^n \, C^[2n+1]_m,s(z) \, S_xy(m)
where the last term in \Eqbbtb is only present for n > 0.
  S_xy(m)\equiv \rho^m \, \sin m\theta = 
    \sum_r=0^2r \le m-1 (-1)^r \beginpmatrix m \cr 2r+1 \endpmatrix \,
    x^m-2r-1 \, y^2r+1 \CRNO
  C_xy(m)\equiv \rho^m \, \cos m\theta = 
    \sum_r=0^2r \le m (-1)^r \beginpmatrix m \cr 2r \endpmatrix \,
    x^m-2r \, y^2r 
The conversion for the cosine like derivatives is:
  \left( B_x, B_y \right)= 
    \frac(-1)^n \, m!4^n n! \, (n+m)! \, C_m,c^[2n] \, \ig[ (n+m) \, (x^2 + y^2)^n \,
    \left( C_xy(m-1), \, -S_xy(m-1) \right) \, + \CRNO
 \hspace13em  n \, (x^2 + y^2)^n-1 \, 
    \left( C_xy(m+1), \, S_xy(m+1) \right) \ig] 
  B_z= \frac(-1)^n \, m!4^n n! \, (n+m) 
    (x^2 + y^2)^n \, C^[2n+1]_m,c(z) \, C_xy(m) \nonumber

###section RF fields

The following describes the how RF fields are calculated when the "field_calc"
attribute of an RF element is set to "bmad_standard".\footnote
  
Notice that the equations here are only relavent with the "tracking_method" for an RF element set
to a method like "runge_kutta" where tracking through the field of an element is done.  For
"bmad_standard" tracking, Equations for "lcavity" tracking are shown in
and "rfcavity" tracking in.
  
Also see Section~ for how fringe fields are calculated.

With "cavity_type" set to "traveling_wave", the setting of "longitudinal_mode" is ignored
and the field is given by
  E_s(r, \phi, s, t)= G \, \cos\bigl( \omega \, t - k \, s + 2 \, \pi \, \phi \bigr) \CRNO
  E_r(r, \phi, s, t)= -\fracr2 \, G \, k \, \sin\bigl( \omega \, t - k \, s + 2 \, \pi \, \phi \bigr) 
  B_\phi(r, \phi, s, t)= -\fracr2 \, c \, G \, k \, \sin\bigl( \omega \, t - k \, s + 2 \, \pi \, \phi \bigr) \nonumber
where G is the accelerating gradient, k = \omega / c is the wave number with \omega being the
RF frequency.

For standing wave cavities, with "cavity_type" set to "standing_wave", the RF fields are
modeled as N half-wave cells, each having a length of \lambda/2 where \lambda = 2 \, \pi / k
is the wavelength. If the length of the RF element is not equal to the length of N cells, the
"active region" is centered in the element and the regions to either side are treated as field
free.

The field in the standing wave cell is modeled either with a p = 0 or p = 1 longitudinal mode
(set by the "longitudinal_mode" element parameter). The p = 1 longitudinal mode models the
fields as a pillbox with the transverse wall at infinity as detailed in Chapter 3, Section VI of
reference \citeb:lee
  E_s(r, \phi, s, t)   = 2 \, G \,                 \cos(k \, s) \, \cos(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) \CRNO
  E_r(r, \phi, s, t)   = r \, G \, k \,            \sin(k \, s) \, \cos(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) 
  B_\phi(r, \phi, s, t)= -\fracrc \, G \, k \, \cos(k \, s) \, \sin(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) \nonumber
The overall factor of 2 in the equation is present to ensure that an ultra-relativistic particle
entering with \phi = 0 will experience an average gradient equal to G.

For the p = 0 longitudinal mode (which is the default), a "pseudo TM_010" mode is used that
has the correct symmetry:
  E_s(r, \phi, s, t)   = 2 \, G \,                \sin(k \, s) \, \sin(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) \CRNO
  E_r(r, \phi, s, t)   = -r \, G \, k \,          \cos(k \, s) \, \sin(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) 
  B_\phi(r, \phi, s, t)= \fracrc \, G \, k \, \sin(k \, s) \, \cos(\omega \, t + 2 \, \pi \, \phi) \nonumber
