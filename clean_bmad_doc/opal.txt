chapter OPAL
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

OPAL (Object Oriented Parallel Accelerator Library) is a tool for charged-particle optic
calculations in large accelerator structures and beam lines including 3D space charge. OPAL is built
from first principles as a parallel application, OPAL admits simulations of any scale: on the laptop
and up to the largest High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters available today. Simulations, in
particular HPC simulations, form the third pillar of science, complementing theory and experiment.

OPAL includes various beam line element descriptions and methods for single particle optics, namely
maps up to arbitrary order, symplectic integration schemes and lastly time integration. OPAL is
based on IPPL (Independent Parallel Particle Layer) which adds parallel capabilities. Main functions
inherited from IPPL are: structured rectangular grids, fields and parallel FFT and particles with
the respective interpolation operators. Other features are, expression templates and massive
parallelism (up to 8000 processors) which makes is possible to tackle the largest problems in the
field.

OPAL uses different longitudinal phase space coordinates compared to Bmad.  Bmad's phase space
coordinates are
  (x, p_x/p_0, y, p_y/p0, -\beta c (t - t_0), (p-p_0)/p_0)
OPAL uses
  (x, \gamma \beta_x,  y, \gamma \beta_y, z, \gamma \beta_z)
"convert_particle_coordinates_s_to_t" and "convert_particle_coordinates_s_to_t" are conversion routines \ldots
