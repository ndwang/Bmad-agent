###section Coupling and Normal Modes

The coupling formalism used by Bmad is taken from the paper of Sagan and Rubin\citeb:coupling.
The main equations are reproduced here.

The analysis starts with the map T(s) for the transverse two--dimensional phase space
coordinates x = (x, x', y, y'). In ring, with a closed geometry, this map will be a one-turn
map starting and ending at some point s. For a machine with open geometry, T(0) can be
computed from the initial Twiss and coupling parameters and T(s) can then be computed by
propagating with the transfer map M_0s from 0 to s:
    T(s) = M_0s \, T(0) \, M_0s^-1

T can be decomposed using a similarity transformation
 can be written as
    T = V \, U \, V\inv 
    , \labeltvuv
where V is symplectic, and U is of the form
    U =
      A \f0 \cr 
      \f0 B \cr
    . \labelua00b
Since U is uncoupled, the standard Twiss analysis can be performed with the A and B
matrices being parameterized using the standard form:
  A = \beginpmatrix
    \cos\theta_a + \alpha_a \, \sin\theta_a \beta_a \, \sin\theta_a 
    -\gamma_a \, \sin\theta_a \cos\theta_a - \alpha_a \, \sin\theta_a
with a similar equation for B. 

The V "coupling" matrix is written in the form:\footnote
  
The form of V and U is not unique. The form of V and U used here essentially
follows the form given by Edwards and Teng\citeb:edteng.
  
    V = 
        \gamma I C \cr 
        -C^+     \gamma I \cr
    , \labelvgicc1
where C is a 2x2 matrix and + superscript denotes the symplectic conjugate:
    C^+ = 
       C_22 -C_12 \cr 
      -C_21 C_11 \cr
    . \labelccccc
Since we demand that V be symplectic we have the condition
    \gamma^2 + \, |C| = 1
    , \labelgc1
and V\inv is given by
    V\inv = 
      \gamma I -C \cr 
      C^+ \gamma I \cr
    . \labelvgicc2
C is a measure of the coupling. T is uncoupled if and only if C = 0.

It is useful to normalize out the \beta(s) variation in the above analysis. Normalized quantities
being denoted by a bar above them. The normalized normal mode matrix \ARU is defined by
    \ARU = G \, U \, G\inv
    , \labelugug
Where G is given by 
    G \equiv 
      G_a \f0 \cr 
      \f0 G_b
    , \labelgg00g
with 
    G_a = 
      \frac\tstyle 1\tstyle \sqrt\beta_a 0 \cr
      \frac\tstyle \alpha_a\tstyle \sqrt\beta_a \sqrt\beta_a
    , \labelg1b0a 
with a similar equation for G_b. With this definition, the corresponding \ARA and
\ARB (cf.~\Equa00b) are just rotation matrices. The relationship between T and
\ARU is
    T = G\inv \, \ARV \, \ARU \, \ARV\inv \, G
    , \labeltgvuv
where
    \ARV = G \, V \, G\inv
    . \labelvgvg
Using \Eqgg00g, \ARV can be written in the form
    \ARV = 
      \gamma I \ARC \cr -\ARC^+ \gamma I
    , \labelvgicc3
with the normalized matrix \ARC given by
    \ARC = G_a \, C \, G_b\inv
    . \labelcgcg

The two normal modes of oscillation are denoted a and b with the a-mode associated with the
A matrix and the b-mode associated with the B matrix. The normal mode phase space
coordinates are denoted  a = (a, p_a, b, p_b). If the one--turn matrix T is uncoupled
then the a-mode is associated with horizontal horizontal motion and b-mode is associated with
vertical motion.

The normal mode coordinates  a are related to the laboratory frame via
     a = V\inv \,  x
    . \labelavx
In particular the normal mode dispersion eta_a = (\eta_a, \eta'_a, \eta_b, \eta'_b) is related
to the laboratory frame dispersion eta_x = (\eta_x, \eta'_x, \eta_y, \eta'_y) via
    eta_a = V\inv \, eta_x
    . \labeletaavx
When there is no coupling (C = 0), eta_a and eta_x are
equal to each other.

In highly coupled lattices there is the possibility of ""mode flips"". An example will make
this clear. Suppose that at one point in a lattice, which will be labeled s_1, the 1-turn matrix
T_1 is uncoupled (V_1 is the unit matrix). The two normal modes at this point will be
labeled a_1 and b_1. and T_1 can be written in the form
  T_1 = 
      A_1 \f0 \cr 
      \f0   B_1 \cr
Further assume that the transfer matrix M_12 between point s_1 and some other point s_2
is of the form
  M_12 = 
      \f0 E \cr 
      F \f0 \cr
The 1-turn matrix T_2 at s_2 will be
  T_2 = M_12^-1 \, T_1 \, M_12
  = \beginpmatrix
      F^-1 \, B_1 F \f0 \cr 
      \f0                     E^-1 \, A_1 \, E \cr
  = \beginpmatrix
      A_2 \f0 \cr 
      \f0   B_2 \cr
This shows that the at s_2 the a_2 normal mode is associated with the b_1 mode and the b_2
mode is associated with the a_1 mode! This is a mode flip. What this means is that in this highly
coupled lattice the excitation of a given "physical" mode will be described using the a-mode in
some places of the lattice and the b-mode in other places. In particular, it is important to keep
track of where there are mode flips when evaluating synchrotron radiation integrals
like I_4a and I_4b  since an individual integral must be evaluated
using the same physical mode throughout.

At any point where Bmad evaluates the Twiss parameters, a "mode_flip" parameter is set. By
default, Bmad sets the "mode_flip" at the beginning of the lattice to "False"
 and then calculates the "mode_flip" parameter appropriately for any other
point. For a lattice with a closed geometry, if the lattice is stable, the "mode_flip" state at
the end of the lattice will be equal to the state at the beginning of the lattice.

###section Tunes From One-Turn Matrix Eigen Analysis

  \includegraphics[width=5in]tune.pdf
a clockwise rotation in (x, p_x) or (y, p_y) space represents a positive tune. B) For longitudinal
oscillations, it is sometimes conventional to take counterclockwise rotation as positive if a machine
is always running above transition.

Given the 6 \times 6 one-turn matrix for a storage ring, one issue is how to extract the tunes. If
there is no coupling the analysis is simple but with coupling things get more complicated. In the
general case, calculating with eigenvectors and eigenvalues gives, assuming that the lattice is
stable, three pairs of eigenvalues with the two eigenvalues of a given pair being complex
conjugates and all eigenvalues having unit amplitude. That is, the eigenvalues \lambda_i, i =
1, \ldots 6 can be ordered in pairs:
  \lambda_1, \, \lambda_2= \exp(i \, \theta_a), \, \exp(-i \, \theta_a) \CRNO
  \lambda_3, \, \lambda_4= \exp(i \, \theta_b), \, \exp(-i \, \theta_b) \labellleit 
  \lambda_5, \, \lambda_6= \exp(i \, \theta_c), \, \exp(-i \, \theta_c) \nonumber
where \theta_a, \theta_b, and \theta_c are the three tunes. To associate \lambda_1 and
\lambda_2, along with their associated eigenvectors v_1 and v_2, with the
"horizontal-like" mode, all the eigenvectors are compared to one another and the eigenvector pair
with the largest values for the x and p_x components are used for v_1 and v_2.
Similarly, for the "vertical-like" mode, eigenvector pair with the largest values for the y and
p_y components are associated with v_3 and v_4, and finally for the "longitudinal-like"
mode the eigenvector pair with the largest values for the z and p_z components are associated
with v_5 and v_6.

It can be useful to arrange the eigenvalues such that the odd numbered eigenvalues (1, 3, and 5) are
associated with the tune and the even numbered eigen values (2, 4, and 6) are associated with the
negative of the tune as arranged in \Eqlleit. The algorithm for doing this can be deduced by first
considering the case where the motion is in one-dimension only. Here taken to be (x, p) as shown
in \figf:tune. Notice that, by the standard accelerator physics convention, a positive tune
represents a clockwise rotation in the transverse dimensions. For the longitudinal mode what counts
as positive tune can depend upon whether the machine is above transition or not. To keep the
mathematics consistent, positive tune for all modes will be taken to be clockwise.

Assuming that the motion is circular, the one-turn matrix M with tune \theta is
  M = \beginpmatrix
    \cos(\theta) \sin(\theta) 
   -\sin(\theta) \cos(\theta)
The eignvalues and eigenvectors are
  \lambda_1= \exp( i \, \theta),  \qquad&v_1 = \frac1\sqrt2 \, (1, i) \CRNO
  \lambda_2= \exp(-i \, \theta),  \qquad&v_2 = \frac1\sqrt2 \, (1, -i) 
Thus, for the eigenvector (1, i)/\sqrt2, were the momentum component is rotated by a factor
of \pi/2 counterclockwise from the position coordinate, the rotation angle is the tune. The
rotation angle associated with the eigenvector (1, -i)/\sqrt2 is associated with the negative of
the tune.

In the general case, each v_k, k = 1, \ldots 6, is a vector in (x, p_x, y, p_y, z, p_z)
space with each component of the vector being a complex number. The criterion that an eigenvector
is associated with the tune is that the phase of the momentum components are on average rotated
clockwise from the position coordinates is
  \wtv_k^* \, S \, v_k=  i, \quad&k = 1, 3, 5 \CRNO
  \wtv_k^* \, S \, v_k= -i, \quad&k = 2, 4, 6
where the tilde means transpose and S is the matrix
  S = \beginpmatrix
      0  1  0  0  0  0 
     -1  0  0  0  0  0 
      0  0  0  1  0  0 
      0  0 -1  0  0  0 
      0  0  0  0  0  1 
      0  0  0  0 -1  0 
\Eqvsvi0, along with the condition 
  v_k+1 = v_k^*, \qquad k = 1, 3, 5
makes sure that the v_k are properly normalized.\footnote
  
Different Authors use different conventions. For example, the S matrix in the paper by
Chao\citeb:chao.spin, is the negative of the S matrix defined here and in the paper by Ohmi,
Hirata, and Oide \citeb:ohmi the phases are reversed (positive phase is counterclockwise rotation)
as can be seen from Eqs.~(77) and (79) in their paper.
  
###section Linear Action-Angle Coordinates

The transformation from the one-turn 6 \cross 6 matrix T in laboratory coordinates to
action-angle coordinates uses the similarity transformation
  T = N \, R \, N^-1
where N is a symplectic matrix. N^T \, S \, N = S with S given in \Eqs010000
and R is a rotation matrix
  R = \beginpmatrix
    R_2(\theta_a)                                   
                     R_2(\theta_b)                  
                                      R_2(\theta_c)
with each 2 \times 2 rotation submatrix R_2 being of the form as M in \Eqmctst.
The transformation from laboratory coordinates x to normal mode a coordinates is
  a = N^-1 \, x
In action-angle coordinates a looks like
  a =\left( \sqrt2 \, J_a \, \cos(\phi_a), -\sqrt2 \, J_a \, \sin(\phi_a), 
                 \sqrt2 \, J_b \, \cos(\phi_b), -\sqrt2 \, J_b \, \sin(\phi_b), \right. 
       \hskip20em \left. 
                 \sqrt2 \, J_c \, \cos(\phi_c), -\sqrt2 \, J_c \, \sin(\phi_c) 
         \right) \nonumber
where J_a, J_b, and J_c are the actions and \phi_a, \phi_b, and \phi_c are the angles.

When the motion is uncoupled, the action and angle of a mode is related to the laboratory coordinates, up
to an overall phase factor via:
  x= \sqrt2 \, J \, \beta \, \cos( \phi ) \CRNO
  p= -\sqrt\frac2 \, J\beta \, \left( \alpha \, \cos( \phi ) + \sin( \phi ) \right) \CRNO

With the eigenvectors normalized with \Eqvsvi0, the particle position x on turn m when a
single mode k is excited can be written in the form
  x(m) = \sqrtJ \, v_k \, e^i \, (\theta_k \, m + \phi_0) + \textC.C.
where the phase \phi_0 is set by the initial particle position x(0) and "C.C." means
complex conjugate.

The N matrix can be constructed using the eigenvectors of T 
  N = \frac1\sqrt2 \, \left( 
    (\wtv_1 + \wtv_2), -i \, (\wtv_1 - \wtv_2), 
    (\wtv_3 + \wtv_4), -i \, (\wtv_3 - \wtv_4), 
    (\wtv_5 + \wtv_6), -i \, (\wtv_5 - \wtv_6)
  \right)
where the tilde means transpose. That is, the \wtv_k are column vectors.

The v_k vectors, k = 1, 3, 5 can each be multiplied by an arbitrary complex phase factor z
with unit magnitude. The corresponding v_k must then be multiplied by z^*
to keep \Eqvv135 satisfied. To recover the standard Twiss parameters, without coupling N
should have the form
  N = \beginpmatrix
    N_a               
           N_b        
                  N_c
where the 2 \times 2 submatrices have the standard form
  N_a = \beginpmatrix
    \sqrt\beta_a                                   0 \cr
    \frac\tstyle -\alpha_a\tstyle \sqrt\beta_a \frac\tstyle 1\tstyle \sqrt\beta_a
with similar equations for N_b and N_c. To make the (1,2) component of these submatrices
zero, along with having \sqrt\beta positive, the k\Th component of v_k, k = 1, 3, 5
must be positive real. This fixes the overall phase of the eigenvectors.

###section Dispersion Calculation

The dispersion \eta is defined in the standard way
  \texteta_x = \eta_x(s) \equiv \left. \fracdxdp_z \right|_s \comma \qquad
  \texteta_y = \eta_y(s) \equiv \left. \fracdydp_z \right|_s

The associated momentum dispersion is:
  \textetap_x = \eta_px \equiv \left. \fracdp_xdp_z \right|_s \comma \qquad 
  \textetap_y = \eta_py \equiv \left. \fracdp_ydp_z \right|_s \comma \qquad 
The momentum dispersion is useful when constructing particle bunch distributions and for
various calculations like for calculating radiation integrals.

To calulate the normal mode dispersions, \Eqavx is used to transform from laboratory to normal mode
coordinates.

The one drawback with the momentum dispersion is that it is not always simply related to the
derivative of the dispersion d\eta/ds. This becomes a factor when designing lattices where, if
some section of the lattice needs to be dispersion free, it is convienient to be able to optimize
d\eta/ds to zero. The dispersion derivative is related to the momentum dispersion by
  \textdeta_x_ds\equiv \fracd\eta_xds
    = \fracddp_z \left( \fracdxds \right)
    = \fracddp_z \left( \fracp_x1 + p_z \right)
    = \frac11 + p_z \, \eta_px - \fracp_x(1 + p_z)^2  \CRNO
  \textdeta_y_ds\equiv \fracd\eta_yds
    = \fracddp_z \left( \fracdyds \right)
    = \fracddp_z \left( \fracp_y1 + p_z \right)
    = \frac11 + p_z \, \eta_py - \fracp_y(1 + p_z)^2

For a lattice branch with an open (non-circular) geometry, the dispersion of the z phase space
coordinate, \eta_z can be defined similar to the dispersion of the other coordinates. In this
case, the dispersion vector eta is defined by
  eta = (\eta_x, \eta_px, \eta_y, \eta_py, \eta_z, 1)
and this vector is propagated via
  eta(s_2) = M_21 \, eta(s_1)
where M_21 is the transfer matrix between points s_1 and s_2.

For an open geometry lattice branch, there are two ways one can imagine
defining the dispersion: Either with respect to changes in energy at the beginning of the machine or
with respect to the local change in energy at the point of measurement. The former definition will
be called "non-local dispersion" and the latter definition will be called "local dispersion"
which what Bmad calculates. The non-local dispersion \wteta(s_1) at some point s_1 is
related to the local dispersion eta(s_1) via
  \wteta(s_1) = \fracdp_z1dp_z0 \, eta(s_1)
where s_0 is the s-position at the beginning of the machine. The non-local dispersion has the
merit of reflecting what one would measure if the starting energy of the beam is varied. The local
dispersion, on the other hand, reflects the correlations between the particle energy and particle
position within a beam.

For a closed geometry lattice branch, defining the dependence of z on p_z is problematical.
With the RF off, z is not periodic so a closed orbit z cannot be defined.  With the RF on, the
dispersion of any of the phase space components is not well defined.  This being the case, \eta_z
is just treated as zero for a closed branch.  

Note: For a closed geometry branch with RF on, it is possible to define dispersions. If v is
the eigenvector of the eigenmode associated with longitudinal oscillations, the dispersion \eta_x
can be defined by v(1) / v(6) with similar definitions for the other dispersion components.
With this definition, the dispersion become complex. In the low RF limit, the dispersions \eta_x,
\eta_px, \eta_y, \eta_py converge to the standard (real) values and \eta_z diverges
to infinity.\footnote
  
This is assuming a linear system. In practice, the motion will become unstable due to
the finite size of the RF bucket.
